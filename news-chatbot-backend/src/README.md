# üìÇ `/src` ‚Äî The Application Core

Welcome to the `/src` directory, the engine room of this application. This is where all the core logic, routing, and configuration reside. The architecture is designed to be **modular, scalable, and easy to navigate**.

-----

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture at a Glance

This project follows a clean, separation-of-concerns architecture. The directory structure provides a clear map of the application's functionality.

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üöÄ server.js       # Application entry point & server initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ app.js           # Core Express app setup (middleware, routes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üö™ routes/          # API endpoint definitions (The "Controller" layer)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öôÔ∏è services/         # Encapsulated business logic (The "Service" layer)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üõ°Ô∏è middleware/      # Request/response pipeline handlers (e.g., auth, error handling)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üîß config/          # Environment variables, database connections, initializers
```

## üé≠ Component Breakdown

Each file and folder has a distinct role in the application.

### `üöÄ server.js` ‚Äî Mission Control

> *"The control center that ignites the engines and launches the mission."*

This is the main entry point. Its primary responsibilities are:

  * Initializing the server and listening for connections.
  * Loading environment variables.
  * Establishing critical connections (like databases) before the app starts.

### `üìÑ app.js` ‚Äî The Orchestra Conductor

> *"Brings all the individual instruments together in perfect harmony."*

This file assembles the Express application. It connects all the pieces:

  * Sets up the core Express app instance.
  * Integrates top-level middleware (like CORS, body-parser, logging).
  * Mounts the main API router.

### `üö™ /routes` ‚Äî The Reception Desk

> *"The friendly front desk that knows exactly where to direct every visitor."*

This directory defines all available API endpoints.

  * Each file typically corresponds to a resource (e.g., `users.routes.js`).
  * It maps HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) and URL paths to the appropriate service logic.
  * **It does not contain business logic.** It only directs traffic.

### `‚öôÔ∏è /services` ‚Äî The Specialist Departments

> *"The expert teams that perform the actual work and know all the details."*

This is where the **real business logic lives**.

  * Each service encapsulates a specific domain (e.g., `auth.service.js`, `payment.service.js`).
  * It interacts with databases, calls external APIs, and performs complex calculations.
  * Keeps the routes clean and focused on routing.

### `üõ°Ô∏è /middleware` ‚Äî Security & Traffic Control

> *"Like airport security and traffic controllers rolled into one."*

Middleware functions intercept and process requests before they reach their final destination.

  * Handles cross-cutting concerns like **authentication**, **request validation**, **logging**, and **error handling**.
  * Can be applied globally in `app.js` or on specific routes.

### `üîß /config` ‚Äî The Setup Crew

> *"Before the show can begin, the stage must be set and the lights turned on."*

This folder contains all environment-specific configurations.

  * Manages database connection strings, API keys, and other secrets.
  * Ensures the application has all the required settings to run correctly.

## üîÑ Request Lifecycle

Understanding the flow of a request is key to debugging and development.

**Client Request** ‚Üí `server.js` ‚Üí `app.js` ‚Üí `Middleware` (Auth, Logging) ‚Üí `Routes` ‚Üí `Service` (Business Logic) ‚Üí **Client Response**

1.  **Launch**: `server.js` starts the application.
2.  **Assembly**: `app.js` configures the Express server, middleware, and routes.
3.  **Arrival**: An incoming API request hits the server.
4.  **Inspection**: Middleware processes the request (e.g., checks for a valid JWT).
5.  **Direction**: The request is passed to the `/routes` directory, which matches the URL to a handler.
6.  **Execution**: The route handler calls the relevant `/services` method to perform the business logic.
7.  **Reply**: The service returns a result, which flows back through the stack to the client as a response.

## üéØ Developer's Compass

Use this guide for quick navigation when you need to make changes.

  * **To add a new API endpoint?**

      * Start in `/routes`. Define the path and method.
      * Create a corresponding method in `/services` to handle the logic.

  * **To modify business logic?**

      * Head directly to the relevant file in `/services`.

  * **To add request validation or security?**

      * Create a new function in `/middleware`.

  * **To change database connections or API keys?**

      * Look in the `/config` folder and your `.env` file.

  * **Application won't start?**

      * The first places to debug are `server.js` and `/config`.
