# 📂 /src — The Application Core

Welcome to the `/src` directory, the **engine room** of this application. This is where all the core logic, routing, and configuration reside. The architecture is designed to be **modular, scalable, and easy to navigate**.

***

## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance

This project follows a clean, separation-of-concerns architecture. The directory structure provides a clear map of the application's functionality.

```

├── 📄 app.js            # Core Express app setup (middleware, routes)
├── 🚪 routes/           # API endpoint definitions (The "Controller" layer)
├── ⚙️ services/         # Encapsulated business logic (The "Service" layer)
├── 🛡️ middleware/       # Request/response pipeline handlers
└── 🔧 config/           # Environment variables, database connections, initializers

## 🎭 Component Breakdown

Each file and folder has a distinct role in the application.

### 🚀 `server.js` — Mission Control
*"The control center that ignites the engines and launches the mission"*

This is the main entry point with these primary responsibilities:

- 🔌 **Initialize server** and listen for connections
- 🌍 **Load environment variables** from `.env` files
- 🔗 **Establish critical connections** (databases, external services) before app starts
- 🚦 **Handle graceful shutdown** and cleanup processes

### 📄 `app.js` — The Orchestra Conductor
*"Brings all the individual instruments together in perfect harmony"*

This file assembles the Express application and connects all pieces:

- ⚙️ **Sets up core Express app** instance and configuration
- 🔧 **Integrates top-level middleware** (CORS, body-parser, logging, security)
- 🗺️ **Mounts the main API router** and defines route hierarchies
- 🛡️ **Configures error handling** and response formatting

### 🚪 `/routes` — The Reception Desk
*"The friendly front desk that knows exactly where to direct every visitor"*

This directory defines all available API endpoints:

- 📋 **Maps HTTP methods** (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) to service functions
- 🎯 **Handles URL path routing** with clean, RESTful patterns
- ✅ **Validates request parameters** and formats responses
- 🚫 **Contains NO business logic** — only traffic direction

**Key principle:** Routes are thin controllers that delegate to services.

### ⚙️ `/services` — The Specialist Departments
*"The expert teams that perform the actual work and know all the details"*

This is where the **real business logic lives**:

- 🧠 **Encapsulates domain-specific logic** (authentication, payments, data processing)
- 🗄️ **Interacts with databases** and external APIs
- 📊 **Performs complex calculations** and data transformations
- 🔄 **Manages state and workflows** within the application

**Key principle:** Services are stateless and focused on specific business domains.

### 🛡️ `/middleware` — Security & Traffic Control
*"Like airport security and traffic controllers rolled into one"*

Middleware functions intercept and process requests:

- 🔐 **Authentication & authorization** verification
- ✅ **Request validation** and sanitization
- 📝 **Logging and monitoring** of API usage
- ❌ **Error handling** and response formatting
- 🚦 **Rate limiting** and traffic management

**Application scope:** Can be applied globally in `app.js` or on specific routes.

### 🔧 `/config` — The Setup Crew
*"Before the show can begin, the stage must be set and the lights turned on"*

This folder contains all environment-specific configurations:

- 🔑 **Manages sensitive data** (API keys, database credentials)
- 🌍 **Environment-specific settings** (development vs. production)
- 🔗 **External service connections** (Redis, databases, APIs)
- ✅ **Validates required configuration** before startup

***

## 🔄 Request Lifecycle

Understanding the flow of a request is key to debugging and development.

```
Client Request → server.js → app.js → Middleware → Routes → Services → Client Response
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step | Component | Action | Purpose |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `server.js` | 🚀 Launch | Starts the application |
| 2 | `app.js` | ⚙️ Assembly | Configures Express server, middleware, routes |
| 3 | Request | 📨 Arrival | Incoming API request hits the server |
| 4 | `middleware/` | 🛡️ Inspection | Processes request (auth, validation, logging) |
| 5 | `routes/` | 🗺️ Direction | Matches URL to handler function |
| 6 | `services/` | 🧠 Execution | Performs business logic and data operations |
| 7 | Response | 📤 Reply | Result flows back through stack to client |

## 🎯 Developer's Compass

Use this guide for quick navigation when making changes:

### 🆕 Adding New Features

**To add a new API endpoint:**
1. 📝 Start in `/routes` — Define the path and HTTP method
2. 🧠 Create corresponding method in `/services` for business logic
3. ✅ Add validation middleware if needed

**To modify business logic:**
- 🎯 Head directly to the relevant file in `/services`
- 🧪 Update corresponding tests in the test directory

**To add request validation or security:**
- 🛡️ Create new function in `/middleware`
- 🔧 Apply to specific routes or globally in `app.js`

**To change configuration:**
- 🔧 Update files in `/config` folder
- 🌍 Modify your `.env` file accordingly

### 🐛 Debugging Guide

**Application won't start:**
- ✅ Check `server.js` for startup errors
- 🔧 Verify `/config` files and environment variables
- 🔗 Test database and external service connections

**API endpoint not working:**
- 🗺️ Verify route definition in `/routes`
- 🧠 Check service method implementation
- 🛡️ Ensure middleware isn't blocking the request

**Authentication issues:**
- 🔐 Review middleware authentication logic
- 🔑 Verify JWT tokens and API keys
- 👤 Check user permissions and roles
