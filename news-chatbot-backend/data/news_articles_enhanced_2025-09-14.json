    "content": "Ricky Hatton - 'always the people's champion' Former world champion Ricky Hatton has died at the age of 46. Nicknamed 'the Hitman', he won world titles at light-welterweight and welterweight and was one of Britain's most popular fighters. His body was found at his home in Manchester on Sunday. A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: \"Officers were called by a member of the public to attend Bowlacre Road, Hyde, Tameside, at 6:45am today where they found the body of a 46-year-old man. \"There are not currently believed to be any suspicious circumstances.\" Hatton, who won 45 of his 48 professional bouts across an esteemed 15-year career, last fought professionally in 2012. 'People's champion who fought with every part of his soul' Ricky Hatton's legacy will 'live on' as tributes pour in for champion boxer \"Ricky was one of a kind,\" wrote former Manchester United and England midfielder David Beckham on Instagram. \"Just heartbreaking.\" Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury wrote on Instagram: \"RIP to the legend Ricky Hatton. \"There will only ever be one Ricky Hatton. Can't believe this - so young.\" Hatton was a well-known Manchester City fan and a minute's appreciation - applause, cheers and songs - was held before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium. City manager Pep Guardiola said Hatton was a \"true champion\" and \"part of the Man City family\". Hatton earned notable world title wins over Kostya Tszyu and Jose Luis Castillo, before defeats by Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. He inspired a devoted following during his glittering career. More than 30,000 fans travelled to Las Vegas for Hatton's title fight with Mayweather in 2007, and a chorus of \"there's only one Ricky Hatton\" echoed around the MGM Grand even after he was stopped. Those same chants were heard in his final professional fight in his home city of Manchester five years later. In July Hatton announced his return to the ring. He was due to fight Eisa Al Dah at middleweight on 2 December in Dubai. Organisers said the contest would be a professional bout, but it was unclear whether it would be fully sanctioned. Hatton made an unsuccessful professional comeback in 2012, when he lost to Vyacheslav Senchenko in Manchester, and fought Marco Antonio Barrera in an exhibition in 2022. After agreeing to fight former rival turned friend Barrera, Hatton spoke about his battles with depression. In 2023 he was the subject of a documentary 'Hatton', in which he discussed his personal life and mental health issues. Hatton won the IBF light-welterweight world title with a superb win over Kostya Tszyu in 2005 Former light-welterweight world champion Amir Khan wrote on X: \"Today we lost not only one of Britain's greatest boxers, but a friend, a mentor, a warrior. \"Rest well, Ricky. You'll always have your place in the ring of our memories.\" IBO world middleweight champion Chris Eubank Jr said: \"Rest in Peace Mr Ricky Hatton. We salute you\". The World Boxing Association said Hatton's legacy would \"live on in every fight and in the hearts of boxing fans around the world\", describing him as a \"true champion, an indomitable spirit and a legend of the sport\". Frank Warren was Hatton's promoter from his professional debut in 1997 to his world title victory over Tszyu in 2005. He wrote on X: \"A superbly talented fighter who inspired a generation of young boxers and fans in a way very few had done before, due to both his personality and the entertainment he provided in the ring. \"From making his debut in Widnes in 1997 to then go on to win one of the most historic fights in British boxing history against Kostya Tszyu in Manchester, Ricky will rightly go down as one of the modern greats of this sport.\" Hatton was 'massive inspiration to me' - Amir Khan pays tribute to former World champion Ricky Hatton A Manchester City club statement read: \"Hatton wore sky blue shorts and used 'Blue Moon' as his walkout song throughout his career. Ricky was one of City's most loved and revered supporters. He will always be remembered.\" Guardiola told Sky Sports: \"It was tough to wake up [to the news]. He had the success and was a world champion, but it is the loss for his family, his kids - he was a grandad. So on behalf of Man City we wish them all comfort in these incredibly tough hours, tough days, tough weeks.\" Former City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports: \"The news is devastating. He's such a British icon - a true Man City fan - but most importantly he was a man of the people. He was the nicest guy ever.\" Former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane described Hatton as a warrior, adding: \"He gave everything for that sport. He left everything in that ring.\" 'Even as a kid, Hatton was knocking everyone out' 'Ricky Hatton was one of us' 'Etched into British sporting folklore' - Hatton's life in pictures Greatest Fights - Ricky Hatton on Hatton v Tszyu Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "content": "Britain will not surrender its flag to those who wish to use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division, Sir Keir Starmer has said. The prime minister said the flag represents \"our diverse country\" and he will not allow people to feel intimidated on \"our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin\". His comments come after more than 150,000 people took to the streets of central London for a \"Unite the Kingdom\" march organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and about 5,000 took part in a counter-protest, co-ordinated by Stand Up To Racism. Earlier, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said marchers were \"demonstrating freedom of association and freedom of speech\". The prime minister said on Sunday afternoon: \"People have a right to peaceful protest. It is core to our country's values. \"But we will not stand for assaults on police officers doing their job or for people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin. \"Britain is nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division.\" Police say 26 officers were injured on the day - including four who were seriously hurt - with 24 people arrested. For most of Saturday afternoon, central London was filled with thousands of people waving mainly union jacks as well as St George's flags. Some Scottish Saltires and Welsh flags were also seen. Speaking about the protests, Kyle said on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg moments like these were \"klaxon calls\" for those in power to redouble their efforts to address the big concerns people have, including on immigration. \"What worries me most is the divisions in our society and other societies and other democratic societies... it's not even the left and the right at the moment,\" he told the programme. \"There are figures such as Tommy Robinson that are able to touch into a sense of disquiet and grievance in the community in our society,\" he said. The \"small minority\" who had committed violence would be held accountable, he told the programme. Tech billionaire Elon Musk spoke to protesters on Whitehall via videolink, telling them to \"fight back\" or \"die\". He also referred to massive uncontrolled migration and called for a change of government in the UK. Kyle criticised some of Musk's comments as \"totally inappropriate\". Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, addressed crowds directly at the march where he criticised politicians for \"parroting\" his ideas. A huge policing operation was put in place for the protests this weekend, with about 1,000 Met officers deployed and an extra 500 from other forces including Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Devon and Cornwall drafted in. Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said: \"There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence.\" The protest was largely peaceful on Saturday lunchtime but as the afternoon continued, tensions flared. The Met said some officers had been attacked while trying to keep the two groups apart and dozens of officers were injured, including four who were seriously hurt. The number of protesters joining the march, organised by Robinson, became too large to fit into Whitehall, police said, and confrontation took place when officers tried to stop them encircling counter-protesters. Mounted police officers used batons to push back the crowds and officers were kicked and punched, the Met said. Three of the 24 people arrested were women and the rest were men, while the youngest and oldest people detained at the protest were aged 19 and 58 respectively, the force said on Sunday. Several people were arrested for more than one offence. The force added officers were working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests.",

    "content": "The family of Virginia Giuffre, who became the most prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has told the BBC that Lord Mandelson should never have been given the position of UK ambassador to the United States. In an exclusive interview on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts said the appointment \"speaks to how deep the corruption goes in our systems\". Business Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC it was \"highly unlikely\" Lord Mandelson would have been appointed if the extent of his relationship with Epstein was known to those in government. There is no suggestion that Lord Mandelson ever met Giuffre. He said last week, that \"perhaps as a gay man\", he never sought or was offered introductions to women from Epstein. Lord Mandelson was sacked by the prime minister this week, after the publication of emails showed the Labour peer sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced jail for sex offences in 2008. Speaking on the programme, Kyle said it was \"extremely distressing\" to watch the interview with Giuffre's family. He said at the time Mandelson was appointed, the UK-US relationship was in a \"perilous state\" and Britain \"needed somebody with outstanding, singular talents\". Kyle said a lot was known about Lord Mandelson's relationship with Epstein during the vetting process and on balance, the decision was taken to appoint him. When asked if the appointment was a mistake, Kyle said: \"They [Giuffre's family] say it was a mistake. \"And retrospectively, if we had known the information that we know now, it is highly unlikely that he would have been appointed because what we know now is materially different to what we understood at the time.\" Giuffre alleged that she was abused by Epstein after she met Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, in 2000 while working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. In 2001, at the age of 17, she said Epstein brought her to London and introduced her to Prince Andrew, who she claimed sexually abused her three times. The prince, who has denied all claims against him, reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology. After many years of campaigning, she had become the most prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre took her own life in April. Giuffre's sister-in-law, Amanda Roberts, told the BBC, \"why does it take us to have to pull out the skeletons for people to be held accountable? Our governments have allowed these people to hold their status and their title without shame\". \"He should never have been given that title. We have to put the spotlight on them. It's unfair we continuously pull these skeletons out, that survivors have to continuously point the finger for us to do the right thing\". Neither Downing Street nor Lord Mandelson wished to comment. Lord Mandelson's sacking came after a cache of emails between the Labour peer and Epstein was published by Bloomberg. In the emails, the peer urged Epstein to fight for early release, and revealed the extent of their contacts and relationship. Lord Mandelson told the BBC he relied on assurances of Epstein's innocence \"that turned out later to be horrendously false\" and has repeatedly expressed regret about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender. Sir Keir decided to sack Lord Mandelson after reviewing those emails on Wednesday night, having expressed confidence in the Labour peer at Prime Minister's Questions earlier that day. Kyle told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the emails revealed a \"material difference\" in what was known at the time of the appointment. But a senior Whitehall figure told the BBC it would have been possible for the government to locate those messages had more questions been asked, and forensic background digging been done. The BBC has also been told Sir Keir explicitly asked Lord Mandelson about his links to Epstein before deciding to appoint him. The questions came after initial vetting of the Labour peer flagged his relationship with Epstein. The Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats have said those in government still had questions to answer about what they knew about Lord Mandelson's relationship with Epstein prior to his appointment. Shadow education secretary Laura Trott said the Conservatives would \"use every mechanism that is available to us to force the truth to come out\". She asked: \"How have we ended up in a situation where the advice for the prime minister is to appoint the 'best pal' of a convicted paedophile to be US ambassador?\" The Lib Dems are also calling for an independent inquiry into what was known about Lord Mandelson's friendship with Epstein at the time of his appointment. Labour MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan said Lord Mandelson \"should never have been appointed\" because his links to Epstein were known. She said the prime minister had to do \"a lot of proving to the public to show he's up to the job\", adding Labour would be \"judged\" at next year's local elections. Mr Roberts, Giuffre's younger brother, said that the firing of Mandelson was a \"step in the right direction\" but \"the reality is that's not nearly enough\". Referencing Jeffrey Epstein's birthday book, to which Lord Mandelson contributed several pages along with dozens of other contributors he added, \"there are still people out there, still people in that book who could be doing this to other young women and children right now.\" Entries from 40 people, divided into several categories such as \"friends\", \"business\", \"science\" and \"Brooklyn\", were published, though the names under \"family\" and \"girl friends\" were redacted. These people are not accused of any legal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein's case. Elsewhere in the interview, Ms Giuffre's brother said Prince Andrew needs to be fully investigated over allegations he sexually abused her. The Duke of York, who has denied all claims against him, reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology. The family's first UK interview was broadcast on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. As well as Lord Mandelson they discuss Epstein, Donald Trump and Prince Andrew, and their hope for Virginia's legacy.

    "content": "Racegoers tried to shelter from the wind and rain at Doncaster racecourse on Sunday Low pressure is sweeping in from the Atlantic bringing a spell of strong winds and heavy rain across the UK. A Met Office Yellow wind warning has been issued across most of England and all of Wales and is valid from 20:00 BST Sunday until 18:00 BST Monday. Coastal gales may develop bringing large waves to southern and western shores. Travel disruption and power cuts are also possible. Places in the yellow warning area will experience the strongest winds which may lead to some disruption Sunday started dry for most but heavy outbreaks of rain will spread in from the west during the day, reaching eastern England and central Scotland by the late afternoon. Winds will strengthen too, especially for south-west England where coastal gales are likely to develop. Throughout Sunday night and into Monday gusts up to 45-55mph are expected inland with 60-70mph possible around coasts and hills. Whilst these wind speeds are fairly typical for an autumn storm like this, trees are still in full leaf, which may increase the chance of branches or small trees coming down. Heavy rain is an additional hazard with 10-30mm falling widely, with some western hills having around 70mm. There is a risk of surface water flooding and difficult driving conditions. The Met Office says it is currently \"not expecting to name the storm\". The warning level for the UK is only yellow, which is the lowest tier. However, storms are named in association with Ireland's Met Éireann and the Netherlands' KNMI, so if the forecast changes in any of these regions, there is a small potential for one of these agencies to name it. A storm is named when it is forecast to cause \"medium\" or \"high\" impacts. The first name in in this season's storm list would be 'Amy'. The current weather pattern is dominated by an active jet stream to the south and low pressure systems moving west to east across the UK As we transition from summer to autumn, we typically see the jet stream moving further south and strengthening in September, which gives rise to more unsettled, stormy weather to move in from the Atlantic. So far this September we've already seen more than the expected rainfall for the whole month for several parts of the UK. As we head deeper into the autumn months most forecast models indicate an increased chance of a 'wetter than average' spell until November in the UK. However, there is always a lot of uncertainty in seasonal forecasts, and these should be interpreted as likely trends rather than expected conditions. It's unlikely we'll see a repeat of September 2024 which was the wettest on record for 10 English counties, including Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Wiltshire. They received more than three times their expected September rainfall leading to widespread flooding. How to stay safe during a storm and what to do in a power cut Monthly Outlook",

    "content": "\"Hey ladies, it's that time again. Please transfer £300 by 7pm tonight for accommodation, matching outfits, and surprise gifts for the bride :)\" It's the message lots of us in our 20s and 30s are used to getting. That includes Hayley, 29, who says she spent more than £1,000 attending a hen party in Marbella, Spain. \"In the WhatsApp groups, it's always initially the flights and the hotel,\" Hayley says, \"and then afterwards it's like, 'OK, we're going to this beach club, we're getting that T-shirt, we're going to do that cocktail club'. \"You feel like you have to do it.\" Hen and stag dos, like weddings and baby showers, are a chance to celebrate big milestones in our friends' lives. But what was once a night down the pub has, for many, become an entire weekend away. And for some, the costs are too much. \"Don't mind me, just choosing whether to attend or pay my rent for the next three months *crying face emoji*,\" wrote one TikTok user, in a video about expensive hen parties. Twenty-nine-year-old Lucy, told me the rising price of friendship feels like it's spiralling out of control. \"It's that time of life where everyone is getting engaged, married or having kids,\" Lucy says. \"And the costs of celebrating all of that adds up.\" \"Money doesn't grow on trees,\" adds Charles, who's 27. \"Lots of my friends work in the public sector, and it's a struggle to keep up.” So what are the pitfalls when organising a hen, a stag, or even a wedding? And is there a way to keep everyone happy? One common theme is that people feel pressured into saying \"yes\" to attending to avoid upsetting friends, or worse, looking cheap. \"I see TikToks all the time, saying: 'Just say no, it's so simple,'\" says Anna, who asked the BBC not to use her real name. \"But it causes so much falling out, it's ridiculous.\" The 29-year-old says her cousin chose to hold her hen party in Spain, at a cost of about £300 per person for flights and accommodation, before factoring in spending money. Anna says she told her cousin she couldn't afford it, but was then hit with passive aggressive messages. \"[She said] 'Just save £20 a month for the next year,'\" Anna says. \"But I didn't have that. Then she said, 'Ask your dad'.\" Begrudgingly, Anna agreed to go - but the hen was then cancelled due to Covid. She's since been invited to a number of other hen parties and weddings. She feels she can't justify the costs - but doesn't want to be labelled as the friend who can't afford it. \"I could imagine the comments behind [my] back,\" Anna says. Then there are the costs when you actually get to said hen, stag or wedding. My best friend Claire got married recently and as a lifelong raver, had decided to hold her hen party in Ibiza. As her bridesmaids, we tried to keep costs down. Hotels were prohibitively expensive, so we opted for a hostel instead. It looked decent online, but turned out to be not dissimilar to a prison cell. With flights, accommodation and spending in bars and clubs, the whole trip set us back about £1,000 each. Still, according to research, we did comparatively well. According to a study from Aviva in 2023, stag and hen invitees spent an average of £779 per person in the UK, and £1,208 abroad. The average price abroad was £1,664 this year, according to a separate study by the insurer. For Jasmine, who's 28, it's the unexpected costs that are the worst. She's been to hen parties where there's been a set price, but then additional payments of up to £100 per person were asked for. \"And you've already committed and you don't want to pull out,\" she says. Jasmine, who's engaged to be married, thinks an appropriate amount to spend should be in the region of £100-200, \"as you'd spend that on a day or night out anyway\". Then there's the thorny question of splitting bills. Another woman, who we're calling Jemima, says on a recent hen weekend, she had to contribute to a central kitty for bars - even though she doesn't drink. \"It made no sense, but you have to go along with the flow,\" the 33-year-old says. \"The bills kept racking up and up.\" This is not just a British problem, either. TikTok creator, Sydney Jo from New York, recently told me as she and her friends approach their 30s, bachelorettes and weddings have become a major source of drama. And that's provided excellent content for her viral series about a girls’ group chat. In a recent episode, set during a bachelorette trip to Costa Rica, one of the characters declares that her friend is \"driving her insane\". \"The money stuff?\" her friend guesses. \"Yes, THANK YOU,\" the 27-year-old replies. \"It's like, refusing to order Ubers, being so annoying about the cheque at every single meal... Seriously? I'm going to lose it.\" Once you're done with the hen and stag do, then you have to factor in the cost of going to the big day itself. Lucy went to a friend's wedding in Switzerland last year which she says cost her about £700. It was in a \"really random town\", she says, which involved taking a train and a bus, and accommodation options were very limited which meant she had to stay in an expensive hotel, driving up costs. Food was covered, but everyone had to pay for their own drinks. \"It was a lovely day,\" Lucy says. \"But very expensive.\" The couple are now getting divorced. \"So that was a waste of money,\" she adds. Elle got married in Cyprus when she was in her early 30s. She's also now divorced, and says, on reflection, it wasn't worth it. Family and friends had flown out, and in the lead up to the wedding activities like paragliding and boat days had been booked, so the costs had really added up. \"Looking back, I wouldn't have done a destination wedding. I know how much pressure it put people under,\" Elle says. \"One of my bridesmaids was upset as she couldn't afford it and for a while she was too scared to tell me. Eventually she did, and I felt really bad.\" So how to navigate this minefield? Personal finance expert Laura Suter has the following advice: Lucy, who's getting married herself next year, says previous experience has made her conscious of costs for her guests. Charles, who's also planning his wedding, agrees. \"Many of my mates already have multiple weddings booked in for next year, and I want to make sure everyone can come to mine,\" he says. \"Speaking to my best man, we might do my stag when the World Cup is on so we don't have to plan activities - everyone will just go to the pub and watch the football - that will definitely save on costs.\"",

    "content": "Charlie Kirk's alleged killer is \"not co-operating\" with authorities and has not confessed to carrying out the shooting, Utah's governor Spencer Cox has told US media. Suspect Tyler Robinson, 22, was taken into custody some 33 hours after Kirk, a 31-year-old right-wing activist, was shot dead in Orem on Wednesday. Speaking to ABC News, Cox, a Republican, said people around Mr Robinson had been co-operating with the investigation. Cox appeared on various US news outlets on Sunday morning, where he also reiterated concerns regarding social media in the aftermath of Kirk's death. The governor was also asked about a New York Times report alleging Mr Robinson had spoken to others after the shooting via the Discord messaging platform, including allegations that he joked about being the gunman. Cox told ABC News: \"All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him. \"It was, it was all joking until, until he, you know, until he admitted that it actually was him.\" Mr Robinson was arrested on Thursday night after surrendering to police. Kirk was speaking at Utah Valley University at an open-air event held by Turning Point USA - the organisation he co-founded - when he was shot and killed. The event was part of the American Comeback Tour, which was a speaking engagement that took him to several college campuses throughout the US. Cox previously told the Wall Street Journal that Mr Robinson, a Utah native, was \"deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology\". When questioned on it during CNN's State of the Union programme on Sunday, he said the information was offered by the suspect's friends and family. \"There's so much more that we're learning and so much that we will learn,\" he explained, adding that when official charges are filed, there will be \"much more evidence and information available then\". The governor said among those co-operating with authorities is Mr Robinson's roommate, who he said was also his partner. He said the partner did not have have any knowledge about the alleged shooting, had been \"incredibly co-operative\" and was working with investigators \"right now\". He also confirmed that the partner was currently \"transitioning from male to female\", but, when asked by CNN, said that authorities do not yet know if that is relevant to the investigation. An affidavit from the state of Utah confirms that Mr Robinson was arrested on suspicion of the crimes of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice. He is currently being held without bail at Utah County Jail. \"We're interviewing all kinds of people - everyone that knows him - and trying to learn more about what the motive actually was,\" Cox said. Following Kirk's death, Cox has been prominent in calling for unity in a bid to ease political tensions, and has made repeated comments criticising social media. He previously called social media a \"cancer\" and told CNN the US had \"to get phones out of the classrooms\" and better efforts to hold platform owners to account. He called Kirk's shooting a \"direct assault on America\" and said Americans needed to \"look in the mirror and decide, are we going to try to make it better, or are we going to make it worse?\"",

    "content": "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged Labour to remain united as she launched her bid for the party's deputy leadership. In a speech in Sunderland, she told supporters to back her to bring the party together, secure a second term and \"deliver the change we want to see and beat Reform\". The Houghton and Sunderland South MP also paid tribute to Angela Rayner, who vacated the deputy leadership when she resigned over her tax affairs, and pledged to continue her campaigning role. Phillipson is up against her former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell, who lost her post as Commons leader in the reshuffle triggered when Rayner quit. She warned the party would not win if it was not united. \"How did we win last [time]? We came together to show the country a different vision for the future. \"I won't pretend this government hasn't made mistakes – I've been first to admit it. \"But we can't afford to look inwards - to go back to bad old days of divided Labour Party and open old wounds. \"If we turn against each other only one person will win – Nigel Farage - but millions more will lose.\" Phillipson pledged to take on Reform UK with a \"mandate to do more\". She was joined by Mayor of the North East, Kim McGuinness, at the Fire Station music venue in Sunderland. The contest is seen by some as a referendum on the Prime Minister's leadership, which has come under pressure amid the loss of two of his government's household names - Rayner and Lord Mandelson - within a week. Phillipson said she planned to use her position to give members a \"strong voice\" at the Cabinet table. \"What can be achieved under a deputy leader with a seat at Cabinet? Just look at Angela Rayner. Angela knew the importance of the role she had. There was nothing part-time about her deputy leadership. \"That's why, today, I pledge to continue Angela Rayner's campaigning role as deputy leader. The winner of the contest will not become deputy prime minister, as Rayner was, because that position has already been handed to Justice Secretary David Lammy. The Education Secretary and Ms Powell now need to secure the support of 5% of constituency parties or at least three affiliates, including at least two affiliated trade unions. The ballot for candidates who clear the nomination hurdles will open on 8 October and close at 12:00 (BST) on 23 October, with the winner announced on 25 October.

    "content": "Romania says a Russian drone has breached its airspace - the second Nato country to report such an incursion. Romanian fighter jets were in the air monitoring a Russian attack in Ukraine on Saturday and were able to track the drone near Ukraine's southern border, the defence ministry said in a statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the incursion could not be a mistake - it was \"an obvious expansion of the war by Russia\". Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims. On Wednesday, Poland said it had shot down at least three Russian drones which had entered its airspace. In its statement, Romania's defence ministry said it detected the Russian drone when two F-16 jets were monitoring the country's border with Ukraine, after \"Russian air attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure on the Danube\". The drone was detected 20km (12.4 miles) south-west of the village of Chilia Veche, before disappearing from the radar. But it did not fly over populated areas or pose imminent danger, the ministry said. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called the incident \"yet another unacceptable breach of an EU member state's sovereignty\". Poland also responded to concerns over Russian drones on Saturday. \"Preventative operations of aviation - Polish and allied - have begun in our airspace,\" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in a post on X. \"Ground-based air defence systems have reached the highest state of readiness.\" Earlier this week Russia's defence ministry said there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil. Belarus, a close Russian ally, said the drones which entered Polish airspace on Wednesday were an accident, after their navigation systems were jammed. On Sunday, the Czech Republic announced it had sent a special operations helicopter unit to Poland. The unit consists of three Mi-171S helicopters, each one capable of transporting up to 24 personnel and featuring full combat equipment. The move is in response to Russian's incursion into Nato's eastern flank, the Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova said. In response to the latest drone incursion, President Zelensky said the Russian military \"knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air\". He has consistently asked Western countries to tighten sanctions on Moscow. US President Donald Trump also weighed in on airspace breach earlier this week, saying he was \"ready\" to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, but only if Nato countries met certain conditions, such as stopping buying Russian oil. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress in the battlefield. Trump has been leading efforts to end the war, but Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin returned from a summit with Trump in Alaska last month.",

    "content": "By Abubakr Al-Shamahi Share Save For almost two years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has gone out of his way to avoid agreeing to a Gaza ceasefire. In November 2023, a deal saw the release of 110 captives taken during Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel. But a week later, Netanyahu refused to extend the ceasefire, leaving the rest of the captives behind. Since then, whenever a ceasefire has seemed to be within reach, Netanyahu has shifted the goalposts. In May 2024, Hamas accepted a proposed deal, but Israel denied agreeing and invaded Rafah instead. By September, Netanyahu had introduced a new condition: permanent Israeli control of the Philadelphi Corridor – the area between Egypt and Gaza – which both Cairo and Hamas rejected. Later, after pushing the position that only a partial deal would be agreed to, Netanyahu changed the parameters and insisted that Israel would only agree to a deal that would see all the captives released – and not in return for an end to the war. Even when allies advanced proposals, Netanyahu sidestepped them. Also in May 2024, then-US President Joe Biden announced that Israel had offered a ceasefire plan, but Netanyahu stayed silent, and no deal followed. When a deal was agreed and implemented, Netanyahu ensured it broke down. In January 2025, under pressure from incoming US President Donald Trump, Netanyahu accepted a phased ceasefire deal that would continue until a final settlement to end the war was agreed. Yet by March, Israel unilaterally violated it, resuming bombardment and blockade. And last week, as Hamas negotiators met in Doha to discuss a new US-backed proposal, Israel bombed them, effectively sabotaging the talks. The Israeli government would insist that deals haven’t been reached because the Palestinian group Hamas has not been an honest broker, and because it will attempt to rearm must be eradicated. But after the attack in Doha, Einav Zangauker, the mother of Israeli captive Matan Zangauker, who has been held in Gaza for almost two years, was clear about who was to blame. “Why does the prime minister [Netanyahu] insist on blowing up any deal that comes close to happening? Why?” she asked rhetorically. Why indeed. Netanyahu is Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. One of the reasons for his success is his ability to keep multiple plates spinning – to juggle different priorities, even if they are sometimes contradictory, without resolving them fully. Being able to juggle these priorities allows Netanyahu to push away decisions that could lead to him losing support from the public or from his political allies. And in a country like Israel, where parliamentary politics is based on who can keep the biggest coalition, that is vital. Netanyahu is also facing domestic legal trouble – he is on trial for corruption – and staying in power is most likely his best bet at avoiding prison. Coming back to the question of a Gaza ceasefire, Netanyahu has a fundamental problem: he is beholden to the messianic far right to prop up his government, and they have made it clear: an end to the war at this stage will see them walk away from the prime minister’s coalition, almost certainly causing it to collapse. The far right – Israelis like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich – want to push Palestinians out of Gaza and bring in Israeli settlers to live in the land left empty by those ethnically cleansed. Netanyahu might not be completely averse to that goal, but he also understands the difficulty in achieving it. Even Israel would be stretched militarily if it were to try to conquer and keep the whole of the Gaza Strip, and months or years of high-intensity conflict would cause more dissent from a military that is heavily reliant on calling up thousands of Israelis as reservists. And, of course, such a brazen attempt at ethnic cleansing would further isolate Israel internationally. Instead, Netanyahu keeps the plates spinning. He keeps Ben-Gvir and Smotrich on his side by never agreeing to end the war, strings along mediators by sending negotiation teams to discuss proposals he won’t accept, and never fully commits to the military fight that would be necessary to try to completely take Gaza. He insists that Hamas cannot be allowed to rule Gaza and rejects the Palestinian Authority ruling the enclave, while also saying Israel doesn’t want to control it. How long can Netanyahu keep this up? There were times when he struggled, and it almost came crashing down. Trump did not want to take “no” for an answer in January, forcing Netanyahu to agree to a deal that had been on the table for more than six months. That led to Ben-Gvir resigning his government position and Smotrich threatening to resign his if the deal progressed and led to an end to the war. As previously mentioned, it did not. And Ben-Gvir quickly came back. Trump says contradictory things about ending the war, only to never firmly tell Netanyahu to stop. The next Israeli elections have to take place before October 2026. Perhaps Netanyahu will be able to present enough wins to the electorate – he can already argue that he has weakened Hamas, defeated Hezbollah, and bombed Iran’s nuclear sites – to get enough support that he is no longer reliant on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich and can end the war on his terms, whatever they may be. Or perhaps the war continues, potentially with pauses, only for Israel to return to bombing Gaza when it feels the need to. Alternatively, continuing the war with no end in sight could increase both foreign and domestic opposition, ramping up the pressure on Netanyahu until he is either forced to make a decision on ending the war or faces defeat at the ballot box in 2026. The Palestinians of Gaza – of whom Israel has killed more than 64,800 – are the ultimate casualties of the dragging out of this war, as well as the Israeli captives still held in Gaza. For now, they will keep suffering – as Netanyahu keeps his plates spinning.",

    "content": "Share Save Britain will “never surrender” to far-right protesters who use the national flag as cover for violence and intimidation, United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer says after violent scenes at one of the country’s largest far-right demonstrations in decades. More than 110,000 people marched through central London on Saturday in a protest against immigration led by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. Some attending the Unite the Kingdom rally clashed with police. Twenty-six officers were injured, and at least 24 people were arrested, according to the Metropolitan Police. In his first public comments since the rally, Starmer said on Sunday that peaceful protest was a fundamental value in Britain, but he condemned assaults on police officers and intimidation against marginalised communities. “People have a right to peaceful protest. It is core to our country’s values,” he said. “But we will not stand for assaults on police officers doing their job or for people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin.” He added: “Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country, and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division.” Saturday’s protest was marked by nationalist symbols, scuffles and inflammatory speeches. Footage showed police on horseback pelted with bottles while baton charges were used to push back Robinson supporters and allow about 5,000 counterdemonstrators to leave the Whitehall area of central London safely. A stage was erected for speeches from a lineup of far-right figures. Leading the charge was Robinson, who told the crowd: “It’s not just Britain that is being invaded. It’s not just Britain that is being raped.” “Every single Western nation faces the same problem: An orchestrated, organised invasion and replacement of European citizens is happening,” he added. International speakers included French politician Eric Zemmour, who echoed the views put forward by Robinson. “We are both subject to the same process of the great replacement of our European peoples by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture,” he said, citing the great replacement conspiracy theory that white Europeans are being deliberately replaced by people from other ethnicities. “You and we are being colonised by our former colonies,” Zemmour added. Similarly, Belgian far-right politician Filip Dewinter declared: “It has to be clear that Islam is our real enemy. We have to get rid of Islam. Islam does not belong in Europe, and Islam does not belong in the UK.” Other speakers included Danish People’s Party leader Morten Messerschmidt, German Alternative for Germany MP Petr Bystron and Polish politician Dominik Tarczynski. Tesla CEO and X Chairman Elon Musk also made an appearance by videolink, telling protesters the UK needed an “urgent change in government” and warning them to “fight back” or “die”. The rally came amid a wave of far-right violence in recent months, including arson attacks on hotels housing asylum seekers. Experts said these incidents, fuelled by conspiracy theories, xenophobia and online disinformation, have intensified concerns over the rise of far-right movements across Britain and Europe, which often spill over into rioting and violence. Assistant Metropolitan Police Commissioner Matt Twist said the violence directed at officers was “wholly unacceptable”. He added: “There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence.” British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also condemned the violence, warning that anyone taking part in criminal acts would “face the full force of the law”. Starmer’s remarks followed calls from the antifascist group Hope Not Hate and several MPs urging the government to act against the surge in far-right mobilisation. Hope Not Hate described the protest as “extremely disturbing”. “While the turnout was significantly smaller than the millions claimed by Lennon and his supporters, it appears to be the largest far-right demonstration ever seen in Britain,” the group said. “For anyone worried about the rise of far-right activism and the normalisation of viciously anti-migrant, anti-Muslim sentiment, it could be a sign of dark times to come,” it added.",

    "content": "Share Save Ducati’s Marc Marquez resisted a spirited challenge from Aprilia’s Marco Bezzecchi to win the San Marino Grand Prix on Sunday, taking his revenge after crashing out of the lead in Saturday’s sprint, and inching closer to the MotoGP title. Bezzecchi had inherited victory in the sprint when Marquez crashed out. This time, however, the determined Spaniard overtook the Aprilia rider on lap 12, having started on the second row of the grid, and never looked back. Marquez’s 11th race victory of the season takes him to 512 points – a record tally for a MotoGP rider in a single season – and he celebrated his victory by unzipping his leathers and holding his red suit up on the podium like a matador. Gresini Racing’s Alex Marquez finished a distant third, and brother Marc, with a 182-point lead, can clinch his seventh title at the Japanese Grand Prix this month. “Today I gave everything I had. It’s true that the mistake from yesterday gave me extra concentration, extra power, extra energy,” an exhausted Marc Marquez said. “I was just there following him [Bezzecchi], trying to push him always super close, because it’s impossible to do 27 laps without any mistake. And in the end, he did a small mistake on turn eight, and then I led the race. “Super important for Ducati; I felt the pressure this weekend.” Six more rounds remain, but Marc Marquez can now win his first title since 2019 if he outscores brother Alex by just three points in Japan. At the start, Marc had a superb launch off the line and he veered to the outside to quickly move up to second behind polesitter Bezzecchi while Alex was pushed down to third. As the top three streaked away, Yamaha’s Fabio Quartararo found it difficult to maintain that pace, and he was soon battling with KTM’s Pedro Acosta, who eventually found his way past the former champion to chase the leading pack. But Acosta’s hopes of fighting for the podium went up in smoke when he retired with a broken chain, with the young Spaniard furiously wagging his finger at the bike after he stopped on the side of the track. Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia had another race to forget in a nightmare season for the twice champion, who crashed out of seventh place, his third place in the championship now seriously under threat from Bezzecchi. Up front, Marc continued piling the pressure on Bezzecchi, and the Aprilia rider finally buckled on lap 12 when he was a breath late on the brakes and went wide, opening the door for the red Ducati to ease past him and into the lead. Bezzecchi gave chase, unrelenting and eager to reclaim the lead. But Marc remained calm and the Spaniard was in no mood to crash out of the lead twice in one weekend. Bezzecchi shook his head in frustration with six laps left as Marc set the fastest lap of the race. Marc tried his best to shake off the younger Italian, who found an extraordinary late race pace to challenge for the lead. But the Ducati rider responded once again as they traded fastest laps and left third-placed Alex more than six seconds behind. “Besides [missing out on] the victory, this is maybe the best race of my life, because I was super competitive all weekend – pole position, sprint win, second place,” Bezzecchi said. “I was close to Marc, who is at the moment the strongest on the grid. I’m very happy, I gave my all, I’m destroyed!” VR46 Racing riders Franco Morbidelli and Fabio Di Giannantonio finished fourth and fifth, respectively, while Gresini’s Fermin Aldeguer was sixth.",

    "content": "Share Save Russia and Ukraine have been engaging in major aerial battles, targeting energy and transportation infrastructure, as Moscow presses its fierce ground assault in the Ukrainian east in the war’s fourth year and tests a type of hypersonic weapon. Russia’s Ministry of Defence announced on Sunday that its air defences shot down 361 drones, four guided aerial bombs, and rockets from a US-made high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS) overnight. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported bringing down a ballistic missile and 164 drones of different types. Russian authorities and Ukraine’s military confirmed that a main target of Ukrainian drones was the Kirishi oil refinery in Russia’s northwestern Leningrad region – one of the largest in the world’s second-biggest oil-exporting country. “Explosions and fire were recorded at the refinery,” Ukraine claimed, calling it a “successful strike”. But the scale of the damage, if any, could not be independently verified. Alexander Drozdenko, the governor of the Leningrad region, said that three drones were destroyed in the Kirishi area and that a fire sparked by falling debris had been put out. He said no one was injured. Attacks on energy infrastructure by both Russia and Ukraine come as United States President Donald Trump has said he is ready to sanction Russia, but only if all NATO allies agree to completely halt buying oil from Moscow and impose their own sanctions. Also in Russia’s Leningrad, two freight trains in separate parts of the region derailed early Sunday, leaving a train driver killed and disrupting railway traffic, according to Governor Drozdenko. An oil company in Russia’s Bashkortostan region will maintain production levels despite a drone attack on Saturday, the region’s Governor Radiy Khabirov said. The incidents came shortly after an explosive device detonated on a section of rail track in Russia’s western Oryol region late Saturday, killing three people. Ukraine did not claim responsibility for these incidents, as with previous ones hitting Russia’s railway network, but its military said it continues to target infrastructure used by Russia to deliver troops, fuel and ammunition to the front lines. Ukraine’s Commander of the General Staff Andrii Hnatov told Ukrainian online video channel Novyny Live that the country may intentionally reduce the quality of 4G and 5G mobile communications in certain areas to prevent Russian drones from accessing the internet to transmit images during attacks. Separately on Sunday, Russia said it had fired a Zircon (Tsirkon) hypersonic cruise missile at a target in the Barents Sea as part of joint military exercises with Belarus. Russia’s Defence Ministry said that long-range anti-submarine aircraft of the Northern Fleet’s mixed aviation corps were also involved in the “Zapad”, or West, joint strategic exercise, and that Su-34 supersonic fighter-bombers practiced a bombing strike against ground targets. In the meantime, a drone breached Romanian airspace during a Russian drone attack on Ukrainian infrastructure overnight, with Romania dispatching fighter jets, which did not manage to shoot down the low-flying projectile before it left national airspace towards Ukraine. Poland also deployed aircraft and closed an airport in the eastern city of Lublin amid Russian drone strikes on Ukraine, with the move coming three days after Poland shot down Russian drones in its airspace with the backing of aircraft from NATO allies. NATO announced a new initiative on Friday to bolster the security of its Eastern European members in the wake of Russia’s violation of Polish airspace. “NATO is launching Eastern Sentry to bolster our posture even further along our eastern flank,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in Brussels during a joint news conference with NATO’s top commander in Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich. “This military activity will commence in the coming days and will involve a range of assets from allies, including Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany,” Rutte added.",

    "content": "By Joe Hernandez , Bobby Allyn People attend a vigil for Charlie Kirk at Western Trails Ranch in Morristown, Arizona, on Saturday. Eric Thayer/Getty Images North America hide caption Utah prosecutors have booked the suspect accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week on an aggravated murder charge. Tyler Robinson was also arrested on charges of obstruction of justice and the felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, authorities said. The 22-year-old Utah resident has been detained in a county jail since he turned himself over to police in connection with the assassination of the conservative influencer Wednesday during an outdoor appearance at Utah Valley University. Robinson is being held without bail. Utah's Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told ABC's This Week that Robinson is \"not cooperating\" with investigators but that \"all the people around him are cooperating, and I think that's very important.\" Cox also said that Robinson was living with a roommate who was a \"romantic partner\" and that that person was a \"male transitioning to female.\" On CNN's State of the Union, Cox said the roommate has been \"incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening, and is working with investigators right now.\" Investigators are trying to figure out if that relationship had any impact on the shooter's motive, Cox added. Formal criminal charges are expected to be filed against Robinson by Tuesday. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said in a statement that he expects those charges to be \"consistent\" with the preliminary charges Robinson was arrested on. A person convicted of aggravated murder under Utah law can face the death penalty. The Department of Justice is expected to file separate federal charges against Robinson. President Trump, who was friends with Kirk, called the activist's death \"a dark moment for America.\" The political organization Kirk founded, Turning Point USA, announced on social media that a memorial service would be held for him next Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which has the capacity to hold over 60,000 people.",

    "content": "Yuki Noguchi Frances Daniels, a Baltimore mother of three, read the Trump administration's 20-page report called \"Make Our Children Healthy Again,\" and noticed some notable words were missing from it: \"Smoking\" and \"nicotine.\" The word \"tobacco\" is mentioned once in the document, in a reference to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. \"I was horrified,\" Daniels says. \"It never once mentioned substance usage. Specifically: nicotine.\" That was of grave concern to Daniels, because nicotine and the chemicals vaped with it, hooked and nearly killed one of her children three years ago. Her child spent six brutal weeks in the hospital with EVALI, a lung injury caused by e-cigarette use. \"They had about six tubes in their lungs at one point, draining fluid out — three on each side with machines on either side of the bed.\" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says the strategy is \"mobilizing every part of government to confront the childhood chronic disease epidemic.\" The administration's list of recommendations in its report calls for public-service campaigns about the risks of alcohol, controlled substances, and vaping. It also recommends continued crack downs on illegally imported vapes, and it announced a $86 million seizure of e-cigarettes last week. NPR has reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services for comment. The report's prescriptions sound too weak to Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. She says it contrasts with President Trump's stance in 2019, when she met with him. \"He was in the Rose Garden and in the Oval Office, talking about youth vaping,\" she says of his emphasis on prevention, during his first term. \"The fact there is not a greater emphasis put on tobacco and nicotine, which is harming youth — it's very, very surprising.\" Tobacco use remains the top cause of preventable death in the US. That's why Brian King — an epidemiologist and former head of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products — says omissions of smoking, tobacco and other nicotine products make no sense. \"Something to combat chronic disease without tobacco control is like attempting a triathlon without a bicycle — you are destined for failure before leaving the starting line,\" King says. King, now executive vice president at the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, says the administration's stated support for public awareness and greater enforcement run counter to its recent actions. \"In the same breath, the administration has eliminated the very unit that conducts that work at FDA,\" he says. He also notes the Trump administration eliminated the Office of Smoking and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which funded state tobacco control programs — some of which King says are in the process of shutting down. Such programs are credited with dramatic reductions in smoking — and more recently vaping — among teens. Earlier this year, the Trump administration also withdrew plans to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes, despite the fact that flavored tobacco and nicotine are known to be a major draw for young people, says Priya Fielding-Singh, director of policy at the Global Food Institute at George Washington University. \"An educational campaign isn't a compelling substitute for enacting tobacco regulation to keep these products out of the hands of kids and teens,\" Fielding-Singh said in a statement. Nevertheless, smoking and vaping are falling out of favor with adolescents, and Penn State public health professor Jonathan Foulds says therefore young people today are at far less risk — especially compared to the many other public-health threats they face. \"Nicotine itself is not very high on the list of public health priorities for kids,\" Foulds says. Nicotine is, of course, addictive and affects heart health. But Foulds says not all forms of nicotine are the same. Oral nicotine pouches like Zyn, for example, and even vaping, may be preferable to cigarette use, he says. \"It's much less harmful than smoking,\" even if it's not harmless, he says. \"We shouldn't exaggerate the risk of it; we should be glad that they're not smoking.\" Foulds says so far there's scant evidence that many people who start vaping in adolescence take up smoking later in life. But in Frances Daniels' experience, it all goes hand in hand. \"Nicotine is harmful, as well as the process of vaping — they're both harmful,\" she says. Her child recovered and quit nicotine, she says. But she continues warning others about the risks.",

Kira received her heart from a 4-year-ld girl who died earlier that evening at a hospital across the city. Also pictured are the heart donor's mother, second from left, and Kira's mom, far right. Kyiv Heart Institute hide caption As a rule, the stories in our \"following up\" series look back at previous articles from Goats and Soda. But when freelance journalist Ruchi Kumar pitched the idea of following up on media coverage of a heart transplant for a 12-year-old girl, whose heart had been weakened by illness, we were interested. Doctors drove through one of the most brutal Russian attacks on Kyiv to collect a heart donated by the mother of a 4-year-old who had died of brain injuries from an accident. Here's a look at that extraordinary night — and how the girl with the transplant is now faring. About This SeriesWe're looking back at some of our favorite Goats and Soda stories to see \"whatever happened to ...\" On the night of July 9, Dr. Borys Todurov, the director of the Kyiv Heart Institute, received a call from a colleague at the Ohmatdyt Hospital across the city. Earlier that evenings, a 4-year-old girl had died of brain injuries from an accident, and her parents had agreed to donate her organs. Todurov had a patient — Kira Skliarova, a 12-year-old girl from Luhansk region of Ukraine — who needed a new heart urgently. Childhood illnesses had severely weakened her own heart. \"She was on the waiting list for a long time, and just one day before we implanted her with a mechanical heart, but she needed a transplant,\" he told NPR. He had to risk his own life to complete the surgery. The donor's body was located about 10 miles from the Heart Institute, which was on that evening under one of the heaviest Russian attacks since the start of the full-scale war in 2022. \"There were Russian missiles and drones everywhere, the air raid alert was going off,\" he said. \"But we had a chance to save a life so took it.\" A video made by Todurov shows their vehicle dodging explosions as Ukrainian air defenses fought off Russian drones. \"On our way, we saw a lot of drones, and buildings that they targeted that were on fire,\" he said. Kira, center, still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. \"Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead,\" Todurov said, \"but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life.\" Kira is flanked by her mother, right, and the mother of her heart donor, left. Kyiv Heart Institute hide caption Kira's family was displaced during the Russian invasion of their region in 2014 and moved to Kyiv as internally displaced refugees. In 2019, the girl developed a severe case of pneumonia, which eventually led to inflammation of the heart. She was diagnosed with post-myocarditis condition, her mother Alyona Skliarova, told NPR over a phone call. For the next six years, Kira endured a rigorous drug treatment regime and was frequently in and out of hospitals. As her condition worsened, especially in the last six months, \"her doctor told us, 'It's time to get her on a waiting list for a new heart,'\" Skliarova said. On July 8, her team of doctors decided the girl was facing imminent death and so operated to fit her with an artificial heart — an assistive device to help her body pump blood. \"When I came to her [after the surgery], she was lying with that mechanism, with the whole thing on the outside, I could see the blood circulating. [It looked] like a suitcase, like the one we take with us when we go to the railway station,\" her mother said. \"I was so shocked, really shocked. That image was not for the faint-hearted people to see,\" she said. \"I wondered, if there isn't a donor heart available, how long could one live with this suitcase device.\" When the attacks of July 9 began, Kira was in the ICU after her surgery. Her mother was in the hospital but had to go to a shelter because of the intense bombing. Her husband — Kira's dad — had died of COVID in 2021. When news of the donor heart came, Todurov did not hesitate. There was a limited window of time to extract the organ and then transplant it. He and his crew — a scrub nurse, a surgeon and an anesthesiologist — drove to the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital amid the bombing and began the procedure, even as the ground beneath their feet shivered from the explosions. \"During the extraction, we could not only hear the noises of drones and missiles but also feel the vibrations of the explosion,\" he said. \"We knew it was very, very dangerous, but once we had the heart, it would only be viable for a few hours outside the body, so we decided to transport it right away,\" Back at their own hospital, Todurov's team wasted no time to prep for the heart transplant — even as they felt the building shake from the explosions outside. Despite the increasing intensity of attacks, they forged ahead. \"Surgeries need to be conducted with precision; you need attention, focus, and we are doing this with explosions around us. We are working to save lives, and they are killing civilians around us,\" Todurov said. \"It was a very serious attack that night, but the whole time, I was praying to all the gods, Kira, Kira, Kira,\" her mother recalled. \"Somehow we survived the night, and when the air raid alarms ended, I went to see Kira.\" Her daughter no longer needed to be connected to the artificial heart contraption. \"I felt a relief,\" she said. \"Our doctors — they are gods on earth. I am so grateful to them!\" Kira still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. \"Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead,\" Todurov said, \"but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life.\" The first three days after the transplant were sensitive, her mother said, as her body adjusted to the new heart. \"She lost some weight at first. Her organs didn't receive enough blood. and she was vomiting when she ate.\" After three days, Kira's body embraced her new heart and her health began to improve. \"She has some issues with spasticity, where her muscle are stiffened, on the right side of her arm, leg and eye. But she is working with a rehabilitation therapist,\" her mother said. Kira's transplant has been a bittersweet moment for the mother of the donor — a 4-year old girl whose organs helped save two other lives that fateful night. The mother of the donor visited Kira, said Aloyna Skliarova, \"and listened to her daughter's heart beat in Kira's chest. On the one hand, that's a tragedy for [her]. On the other hand, it became a chance for life.\" She added with gratitude: \"I respect her so much, and I'm so grateful for her decision. She gave my child a chance to live.\" Mother and daughter are determined to make the best of this new lease at life. \"I hope we will have more walks in parks, catch up on everything. There are a lot of things in Kyiv that we haven't yet seen, because we've spent these six years in hospitals or laying at home with the sickness,\" Skliarova said. One dream is to visit the Carpathian Mountains. \"I was there once and I want Kira to see this beauty, go for a walk, climb on [the mount] Khomyak,\" she said. \"We are planning to live. Just to enjoy life, with this new heart. Only God knows what the future will be like, but yes, there is a will to live.\" Ruchi Kumar is a journalist who reports on conflict, politics, development and culture in India and Afghanistan.

    "content": "By The Associated Press Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks with members of the media before departing for Israel at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Saturday, Sept. 13, 2025. Nathan Howard/POOL REUTERS/ AP hide caption JERUSALEM (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Israel on Sunday, as Israel intensified its attacks against northern Gaza, flattening another high-rise building and killing at least 12 Palestinians. Rubio said ahead of the trip that he will be seeking answers from Israeli officials about how they see the way forward in Gaza following Israel's attack on Hamas operatives in Qatar last week that upended efforts to broker an end to the conflict. His two-day visit is also a show of support for the increasingly isolated Israel as the United Nations holds what is expected to be a contentious debate on commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly opposes the recognition of a Palestinian state. Rubio's visit went ahead despite President Donald Trump's anger at Netanyahu over the Israeli strike against Hamas leaders in Doha, which he said the United States was not notified of beforehand. On Friday, Rubio and Trump met with Qatar's prime minister to discuss the fallout from the Israeli operation. The dual, back-to-back meetings with Israel and Qatar illustrate how Trump administration is trying to balance relations between key Middle East allies despite the attack's widespread international condemnation. The Doha attack also and appears to have ended attempts to secure an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and the release of hostages ahead of the upcoming U.N. General Assembly session, at which the Gaza war is expected to be a primary focus. On Sunday, at least 13 Palestinians were killed and dozens were wounded in multiple Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to local hospitals. Local hospitals said Israeli strikes targeted a vehicle near Shifa hospital and a roundabout in Gaza City, and a tent in the city of Deir al-Balah that killed at least six members of the same family. Two parents, their three children and the children's aunt were killed in that strike, according to the Al-Aqsa hospital. The family was from the northern town of Beit Hanoun, and arrived in Deir al-Balah last week after fleeing their shelter in Gaza City The Israeli military did not have immediate comment on the strikes. Smoke rises after an Israeli military strike on a building in Gaza City, Saturday, Sept. 13, 2025. Yousef Al Zanoun/AP hide caption As part of its expanding operation in Gaza City, the Israeli military destroyed a high-rise residential building on Sunday morning, less than an hour after an evacuation order posted online by the military spokesman Avichay Adraee. Residents said said the Kauther tower in the Rimal neighborhood was flattened to the ground. There were no immediate reports of casualties. \"This part of the genocidal measures the (Israeli) occupation is carrying out in Gaza City,\" said Abed Ismail, a Gaza City resident. \"They want to turn the whole city into rubble, and force the transfer and another Nakba.\" Israeli strongly denies accusations of genocide in Gaza. Separately, two Palestinian adults died of causes related to malnutrition and starvation in the Gaza Strip over the last 24 hours, the territory's health ministry reported Sunday. That has brought the death toll from malnutrition-related causes to 277 since late June, when the ministry started to count fatalities among this age category, while another 145 children died of malnutrition-related causes since the start of the war in October 2023, the ministry said. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, abducting 251 people and killing some 1,200, mostly civilians. There are still 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, of whom 20 Israel believes are still alive. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,803 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says around half of those killed were women and children. Large parts of major cities have been completely destroyed and around 90% of some 2 million Palestinians have been displaced.",

    "content": "Larry Kaplow Loading... Missouri is the latest state redrawing its voting map to help Republicans hold onto their majority in the U.S. House. The state Senate voted Friday for a redistricting plan requested by President Trump that would help Republicans win a seat now held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. The plan now goes to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who's expected to sign it. He had already called on lawmakers to approve the map he says reflects \"Missouri's conservative, common sense values.\" Missouri Democrats said this is a gerrymander that dilutes the votes of Black voters, especially around Kansas City, where voters will be split into different congressional districts. Two lawsuits have already been filed against the plan and a group is organizing a voter petition drive that could block it. States usually redistrict at the start of the decade following the national census but Trump has set off a redistricting race around the country. Holding the Republican advantage in the U.S. House is key to Trump's agenda and protects his administration from investigations that a Democratic-led House might launch. Trump convinced Texas lawmakers to draw new maps that could help Republicans win five more seats. He's called on other Republican-led states to redraw their maps too and the issue is rippling across the country. In the last six midterm elections, the party that held the White House has lost seats in the U.S. House. Trump has repeatedly stated that he wants states to redistrict to help Republicans hold onto the House. In July, he called on Texas lawmakers to give Republicans an advantage in five more seats in that state and they did. Trump has urged Indiana and Florida to follow and that could yield one or two additional wins for Republicans in each place. Republicans there are considering their options. The new Missouri congressional map was on display in the state House on Tuesday in Jefferson City. It's been challenged in court but if enacted it could help Republicans win a seat now held by a Democrat. Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio hide caption California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom led the Legislature in countering Texas by drawing a map that would help his party win five seats there. That plan will go to voters for approval in an election Nov. 4, after what's expected to be an expensive statewide campaign. Like several other states, California had left redistricting to an independent commission designed to reduce political influence on the process. The partisan map, if passed at the polls, would replace the independent commission's work for the next three elections. The governors of Illinois and Maryland have left the door open to redistricting that could yield an edge for Democrats in a congressional seat or two in each state. New York could also try to redistrict but couldn't allow it to take effect until the 2028 election. Then there are two outlier states. Ohio's current map is expiring because it didn't meet state requirements for bipartisan support when it passed in 2022. That could end up yielding Republicans a couple more advantageous seats. And in Republican-led Utah, a court found that the state's current map was the product of illegal political gerrymandering and has ordered a new one be drawn. That could yield a seat ripe for a Democrat to win. But the Republican-led Legislature is challenging that order in court. There are 435 members of the U.S. House representing about 760,000 people each. Every 10 years, as populations change, the national census shows how many seats each state gets and the states draw new district maps. However people vote, the way their votes are divided up into districts can determine how many seats favor Republican or Democratic candidates. Gerrymandering is the name for when the party in power draws the lines to favor their candidates, sometimes ending up with irregularly shaped districts that make a district lean toward a party. Gerrymandering for political advantage is legal in many states. But it can make their congressional delegations more heavily tilted to one party than the population is in general and it can lead to a more polarized, gridlocked Congress. It's illegal to gerrymander to dilute the voting power of a racial group. That's often been done by \"cracking\" communities into different districts or \"packing\" them together to take them from neighboring districts. These laws, under the Voting Rights Act, could be reconsidered by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case it is scheduled to hear in October. That could lead more states to redraw their lines.",

Mirrorpix/Mirrorpix via Getty Images hide caption ISLE OF LEWIS, Scotland — On a windswept island 40 miles off Scotland's northwest coast, a 19th century castle turned museum echoes with Gaelic ballads about homesickness and loss. For centuries, islanders lined fishing docks below the castle, waving handkerchiefs at ships setting sail for America. Generations of locals left hardscrabble poverty on the Isle of Lewis, in Scotland's Outer Hebrides, for opportunities abroad. Lews Castle on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands. Lauren Frayer/NPR hide caption Lews Castle is now home to a museum which includes an exhibit about emigration from the island. Lauren Frayer/NPR hide caption Among them, in the early 20th century, were all 10 children of a local sub-postmaster, Malcolm MacLeod, and his wife Mary — including their youngest, Mary Anne MacLeod, born in 1912. She became the mother of Donald Trump. Donald Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, en route to New York, circa 1932. Mirrorpix/Mirrorpix via Getty Images/Getty Images hide caption When President Trump arrives in the United Kingdom on Tuesday for a state visit at Windsor Castle, hosted by King Charles III, he'll also be arriving in his mother's homeland — a place where his maternal family roots go back centuries. Trump's mother was an immigrant, a native Gaelic speaker who learned English as a second language. She and her siblings were part of a phenomenon of family-based migration to the United States, which American immigration hardliners have deemed \"chain migration\" — and her son's administration has sought to stop. Even in the era of modern air travel, the Isle of Lewis isn't easy to reach. When NPR visited in August, via a tiny commercial flight from Glasgow, the pilot got on the PA system to warn that a nasty haar — a Scottish sea fog — might imperil our trip. We had to circle the island several times before attempting to land — the only flight able to do so that day. Aerial photo of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. Lauren Frayer/NPR hide caption It's a stunning place, sparsely forested, coated with farmland and peat bogs, cut with jagged ravines and lined with a ribbon of white sand lapped by frigid turquoise waters. At its tip, the North Atlantic meets the Norwegian Sea, as you look north toward the Arctic. It's a place more accustomed to people leaving than arriving. Local culture is infused with goodbyes, says archivist Seonaid McDonald, who helped curate an exhibit at Lews Castle about emigration from the island. \"From the late 18th century, people began to leave in larger numbers. There was also a severe potato famine here as well as in Ireland in the 1840s,\" she explains. \"Although they were leaving for reasons of trying to improve themselves, they had a terrible sense of homesickness.\" Most went to Canada or the U.S., even more than to mainland Scotland, she says.

UniversalImagesGroup/Getty Images hide caption She chokes up, pointing to a museum display with black and white photos of islanders waving goodbye from a dock to loved ones on the deck of a ship. \"The people who left were very poor,\" she says. \"They might be [abroad] for decades before they could come back to visit — by which time, their parents would have died.\" Even today, \"a large proportion of people here have an empathy for those that have to flee their homelands for different reasons, whether it's oppression, poverty, war,\" McDonald says. The biggest town on the Isle of Lewis, and in the entire Outer Hebrides chain, is Stornoway — population around 7,000. Mary Anne MacLeod grew up in a suburb, a village called Tong — really just a cluster of houses, including the early 20th century squat gray stucco bungalow that was her family's home. The house where Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, grew up in the village of Tong on the Isle of Lewis, in Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands. Lauren Frayer/NPR hide caption Locals call it a \"white house.\" But that's not a reference to her son's current residence in Washington. It's in contrast to \"blackhouses,\" traditional thatched-roof dwellings that housed both people and their livestock, and were the norm in the Outer Hebrides until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The name comes from how their interior walls were blackened from burning peat. MacLeod's father Malcolm ran a post office out of an annex on their modern house. \"Because he ran the post office, telegrams, letters, parcels, clothes and money would have come in from across the globe. So the little house [Mary Anne] lived in was the global crossroads for the village,\" says Torcuil Crichton, a member of the center-left ruling Labour Party who represents the Outer Hebrides in the U.K. Parliament. It's the country's smallest constituency. His own mother also grew up in Tong. Exposure to the outside world, through her father's work, must have whetted MacLeod's appetite for travel, Crichton says. Her prospects on the island were also limited: There was little work for women besides gutting herring. Many of the area's eligible bachelors had been killed or wounded in World War I. Hundreds died in a mass drowning incident that followed. In the mid-1920s, a teenaged MacLeod followed her older sisters to New York City. She may have worked initially as a maid or nanny, as many immigrant women did in that era, says Calum Angus Mackay, who made a Gaelic TV documentary about MacLeod, based on letters she sent to a lifelong pen pal in Dundee, on the Scottish mainland. Donald Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, as a teenager at her home in the village of Tong, on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands. Mirrorpix/Getty Images hide caption \"It is primarily a rags to riches [story]!\" Mackay says. \"Mary Anne basically left with a ... bag under her arm, and very little money.\" In 1929, when the U.S. stock market crashed, she returned to Scotland. But by then she'd met a real estate developer named Fred Trump — who convinced her, in letters, to return to New York and marry him, which she did in 1936. From then on, the photos she sent home showed a woman transformed, says Crichton, who also reviewed MacLeod's pen pal correspondence and collaborated with Mackay on the Gaelic documentary. \"There's one [photo], on the steps of an upstate New York swimming pool, where she's wearing a bathing costume, her hair is now dyed blonde, and she looks like she's walked out of the pages of The Great Gatsby or a Hollywood movie,\" Crichton says. \"It's the story of the old world and the new world, and really it's the story of 20th century America.\" On the Isle of Lewis, the MacLeod clan goes back to the Middle Ages. It's still one of the most common surnames on the island. Their signature tartan plaid is yellow and black. A volunteer at the Stornoway Historical Society, Catherine MacLeod, explains how she didn't need to change her name when she got married; her maiden and married names were both MacLeod. \"In high school, on the very first day, we were put in alphabetical order, and you would have A to L, and [then just the] M's. Because you have all the McDonalds, McKenzies, and then MacLeods with the same name!\" says Anna Tucker, another volunteer. \"You'd have Donald MacLeod A, Donald MacLeod B and often even a Donald MacLeod C.\" Tucker's maiden name was MacLeod, and so was her mother's. Both of her grandfathers were named Angus MacLeod, she says. \"We have hundreds and hundreds of visitors from the States and Canada coming every year, looking for their ancestors,\" Tucker says. \"And it's confusing to figure out which MacLeod branch to tell them!\" MacLeod family gravestones in a cemetery on the edge of the hamlet of Gress, on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands. Lauren Frayer/NPR hide caption In a cemetery in the hamlet of Gress, the closest burial place to where Trump's mother grew up, more than half of the headstones bear the MacLeod family name. One of Trump's cousins still lives in the bungalow where the president's mother grew up. But there's no plaque or sign, and the cousin didn't want to talk with NPR. Signs in one shop window in Stornoway say \"Shame on you, Donald John!\" Public opinion is divided over Trump, Mackay says, but locals are proud of his mother's trajectory. Anti-Trump signs in the window of a building in Stornoway, the biggest town on the Isle of Lewis, in Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands. Lauren Frayer/NPR hide caption Last winter after Trump was reelected, Crichton, the local member of Parliament, sent a holiday card to the White House — from one politician to another, across the aisle, from the old world to the new one, he says — inviting Trump back for a visit. \"If he came home, he'd see his mother's story, and the hard work, actually! The determination that made America great,\" Crichton says. \"And it's still going on! It's coming from different parts of the world. But isn't that the story of America? How beautifully and fantastically it renews itself all the time.\" MacLeod, after becoming a U.S. citizen and Mrs. Fred Trump, came home many times over the years, showering neighbors with gifts, sitting in the family pew at church and slipping back into her native Gaelic language — as if she'd never left, locals say. As a child, Donald Trump joined her at least once. In 2008, he returned with his oldest sister Maryanne and visited that bungalow — staying inside for just 97 seconds, according to media reports at the time. Donald Trump during a 2008 visit to the house where his mother grew up in the village of Tong, on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands. Andrew Milligan/Getty Images hide caption He's been to Scotland many times since then, but apparently never again to his mother's home island. When Trump arrives in the U.K. Tuesday, he's expected to stay in England, visiting Windsor Castle and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's country retreat Chequers, outside London. Crichton says his invitation to the Isle of Lewis still stands, but he doesn't think the U.S. president will take him up on it. \"Because to acknowledge his mother's story of chain migration, which is the kind of — let's face it — the kind of woman he wants to stop coming into America right now, I think to acknowledge that would be to kind of go against lots of his own policies and beliefs,\" he says. Mary Anne MacLeod died in the summer of 2000, aged 88, without seeing her son reach the White House. But at Trump's first inauguration, in 2017, he swore the oath of office on a Bible from the Isle of Lewis — given to him by his mother.",

    "content": "By The Associated Press A demonstrator stands on the head of the South Bank lion that sits on the side of the Westminster Bridge, during a Tommy Robinson-led Unite the Kingdom march and rally in London, on Saturday. Joanna Chan/AP hide caption LONDON — A London march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew more than 110,000 people and became unruly on Saturday as a small group of his supporters clashed with police officers who were separating them from counterprotesters. Several officers were punched, kicked and struck by bottles tossed by people at the fringes of the \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally, Metropolitan Police said. Reinforcements with helmets and riot shields were deployed to support the 1,000-plus officers on duty. Twenty-six police officers were injured — four who were seriously hurt, including broken teeth and a concussion, a possible broken nose and a spinal injury. At least 25 people were arrested for offenses including violent disorder, assaults and criminal damage, and the investigation continues, police said. \"There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence,\" Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said. \"They confronted officers, engaging in physical and verbal abuse and making a determined effort to breach cordons in place to keep everyone safe.\" The rally drew an estimated crowd of between 110,000 and 150,000 people, far surpassing expectations, police said. The rival \"March Against Fascism\" protest organized by Stand Up To Racism had about 5,000 marchers. Tommy Robinson speaks during the Unite the Kingdom march and rally near Westminster, London, on Saturday. Joanna Chan/AP hide caption Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founded the nationalist and anti-Islam English Defense League and is one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain. The march was billed as a demonstration in support of free speech — with much of the rhetoric by influencers and several far-right politicians from across Europe aimed largely at the perils of migration, a problem much of the continent is struggling to control. \"We are both subject to the same process of the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture, you and we are being colonized by our former colonies,\" far-right French politician Eric Zemmour said. Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and owner of the X platform who has waded into British politics several times this year, was beamed in by video and condemned the left-leaning U.K. government. \"There's something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion, but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration,\" he said. Robinson told the crowd in a hoarse voice that migrants now had more rights in court than the \"British public, the people that built this nation.\" The marches come at a time when the U.K. has been divided by debate over migrants crossing the English Channel in overcrowded inflatable boats to arrive on shore without authorization. Numerous anti-migrant protests were held this summer outside hotels housing asylum-seekers following the arrest of an Ethiopian man who was later convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a London suburb. Some of those protests became violent and led to arrests. Participants in the \"Unite the Kingdom\" march carried the St. George's red-and-white flag of England and the union jack, the state flag of the United Kingdom, and chanted \"we want our country back.\" U.K. flags have proliferated this summer across the U.K. — at events and on village lampposts — in what some have said is a show of national pride and others said reflects a tilt toward nationalism. Supporters held signs saying \"stop the boats,\" \"send them home,\" and \"enough is enough, save our children.\" At the counterprotest, the crowd held signs saying \"refugees welcome\" and \"smash the far right,\" and shouted \"stand up, fight back.\" Robinson supporters chanted crude refrains about U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, leader of the center-left Labour Party and also shouted messages of support for slain U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Several speakers paid tribute to Kirk, who was remembered in a moment of silence, followed by a bagpiper playing \"Amazing Grace.\" One demonstrator held a sign saying: \"Freedom of speech is dead. RIP Charlie Kirk.\" The crowd at one point stretched from Big Ben across the River Thames and around the corner beyond Waterloo train station, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile (around a kilometer). The marches had been mostly peaceful, but toward the late afternoon, \"Unite the Kingdom\" supporters threw items at the rival rally and tried to break through barriers set up to separate the groups, police said. Officers had to use force to keep a crowd-control fence from being breached. Counterprotesters heckled a man with blood pouring down his face who was being escorted by police from the group of Robinson supporters. It wasn't immediately clear what happened to him. While the crowd was large, it fell far short of the one of the biggest recent marches when a pro-Palestinian rally drew an estimated 300,000 people in November 2023. Robinson had planned a \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally last October, but couldn't attend after being jailed for contempt of court for violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. He previously served jail time for assault and mortgage fraud.",

    "content": "Rights group also finds rise in openly gay, bisexual and transgender people running for office in 36 countries Politicians in at least 51 countries used homophobic or transphobic rhetoric during elections last year, from depicting LGBTQ+ identity as a foreign threat to condemning “gender ideology”, according to a new study of 60 countries and the EU. However, there were also gains for LGBTQ+ representation in some countries. Openly gay, bisexual and transgender people ran for office in at least 36 countries, including for the first time in Botswana, Namibia and Romania – albeit unsuccessfully – according to the report by Outright International. The number of LGBTQ+ elected officials doubled to at least 233 in Brazil. As the visibility of LGBTQ+ people has risen in many countries in the last decade, so too has a backlash from conservative parts of societies, fuelled in many cases by far-right activists and politicians using gay and transgender people as scapegoats for other problems. There is a growing “weaponisation of hate”, said Alberto de Belaúnde, a director at Outright International, an NGO that promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally. He said: “You talk with a politician from Peru … or Hungary or the UK, you start to see common trends and you realise that it’s a global, coordinated and increasingly well-funded effort to diminish LGBTIQ people.” LGBTQ+ candidates for office were subject to online hate speech from election opponents and their supporters in El Salvador, Finland, Pakistan and the US, where Sarah McBride was elected as the first transgender member of the House of Representatives. During the 2024 US elections, Republican campaigns spent $200m (£147.5m) on anti-transgender adverts on network TV (not including cable TV or streaming), according to data from advert tracking firm AdImpact. In the campaign for parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in October 2024, the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed that LGBTQ+ activists were “foreign agents” of the west, out to corrupt the country’s “traditional values”. During election campaigns in Ghana, where gay sex is criminalised under a colonial-era law, both of the two main parties said they would protect “family values” while accusing the other of being pro-LGBTQ+. Before the June 2024 EU elections, in which far-right parties made big gains, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that the “Brussels elite and the Soros network, fattened up with EU money, are waging an ideological war: re-educating our children with gender propaganda.” In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said it was against “other forms of cohabitation than between a man and a woman” being treated equally. In Indonesia, which voted in February 2024, the National Human Rights Commission condemned reports that politicians had vowed to “eradicate LGBT”. And while all three main parties in Pakistan promised to respect the rights of transgender people, trans candidates reported being verbally harassed in person as well as online on the campaign trail for the February 2024 vote. The Outright International report said that rises in discrimination against minorities had come hand in hand with growing authoritarianism: “In 2024, as in previous years, LGBTIQ communities and other marginalised groups were among the first casualties of these anti-democratic attacks.”",

    "content": "The International IDEA’s survey of democratic markers finds US is offering ‘encouragement’ to populist leaders Press freedom around the world has suffered its sharpest fall in 50 years as global democracy weakens dramatically, a landmark report has found. According to the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), democracy has declined in 94 countries over the last five years and only a third have made progress. “Democracy faces a perfect storm of autocratic resurgence and acute uncertainty, due to massive social and economic changes,” Kevin Casas-Zamora, the secretary-general of the thinktank, said. “To fight back, democracies need to protect key elements of democracy, like elections and the rule of law, but also profoundly reform government so that it delivers fairness, inclusion and shared prosperity.” The International IDEA’s survey – the Global State of Democracy Report 2025 – is published annually and considered the most comprehensive of its kind, covering 174 countries and measuring democratic performance from 1975. The survey found that the freedom of the press had worsened in a quarter of the countries, marking the broadest deterioration since the beginning of the dataset. The three largest declines were seen in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso and Myanmar, all suffering historically high levels of civil conflict, poverty and political instability. The fourth-largest took place in South Korea, where the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, repeatedly targeted critical media and his government used defamation lawsuits to silence journalists before being ousted earlier this year. The report described greatly differing contexts for problems facing the media. In New Zealand, it said, a crisis has been marked by the shrinking of the media landscape, leaving four out of five journalists working for one of only five employers. In Palestine, it said, nearly 200 journalists have been killed since October 2023, and Israel has imposed a blockade on international press entering the Gaza Strip independently. “Between 2024 and 2025, Al Jazeera was targeted by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which have suspended the media outlet’s operations over alleged national security concerns and tensions over its coverage of certain events,” the report notes. Chile recorded the largest improvement in freedom of expression since the International IDEA’s last report in 2021, owing in part to landmark draft legislation aimed at enhancing the safety of journalists, as well as their families. The thinktank highlighted some positive developments: Africa recorded a large share of the global advances in democracy, accounting for 24% of the countries making progress – most notably Botswana and South Africa. Parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2024 were praised for increased fairness and Poland saw improvements too. But the US, though a country long regarded as a leading advocate for democracy worldwide, has significantly reduced both its diplomatic engagement and its financial support for international democracy assistance this year, the report’s authors wrote. “These developments have contributed to a weakening of international democratisation efforts. In less than six months, US domestic political institutions have also lost much of their symbolic sheen, increasingly serving as a reference point for executive overreach and offering more encouragement to populist strongman leaders than to pro-democracy hopefuls,” they said. In 2021, International IDEA added the US to its list of “backsliding” democracies for the first time, pointing to a “visible deterioration” that it said began in 2019. One measure that may encourage and reinforce democracy would be wider offering of votes for people living abroad, the thinktank argues. “Improving rights of voters living abroad can also reap democratic dividends in both home and host countries,” said Casas-Zamora.",

    "content": "Death of anti-apartheid activist in 1977 after police beat him into a coma sparked outrage across the world South African prosecutors will reopen an inquest into the death of the prominent anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, nearly 50 years after he died in police custody. Biko, the founder of South Africa’s Black Consciousness Movement, died in a prison cell in 1977 aged just 30, after being beaten into a coma by police who had arrested him nearly a month earlier. The death sparked outrage across the world and he became an international symbol of the struggle against the race-based apartheid system that denied South Africa’s black majority political and economic rights. “The main goal of reopening the inquest is to lay before the court evidence that will enable the court to make a finding … as to whether the death was brought about by any act, or omission, which prima facie involves or amounts to an offence on the part of any person,” the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Wednesday. The case will be reopened on the 48th anniversary of Biko’s death on 12 September. A 1977 inquest accepted the police account that Biko sustained injuries when he hit his head against the wall and no one was prosecuted for the death. But in 1997, former police officers implicated in the case admitted assaulting the activist during hearings by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) into atrocities committed during the apartheid era. The TRC refused to grant amnesty to the officers, ruling that they lied in their evidence and failed to prove a political motive for killing Biko.

The decision to reopen the inquest is the latest in a string of moves to re-examine high-profile apartheid-era deaths. In April the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, launched an inquiry into whether past ANC governments interfered with the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes, amid criticism from the families of victims. In June an inquest was opened into one of the period’s most notorious crime: the deaths of four men known as the Cradock Four, who were stopped at a roadblock in 1985 by security officers and beaten, strangled with telephone wire, stabbed and shot to death.",

    "content": "Minister admits there is ‘no proper plan’ to tackle violent crime in divided city that pulls in 2.4 million visitors Six people have been shot dead in two days in a crime-plagued area of Cape Town, adding to the death toll in a city already reeling from the scourge of gang-related violence. At 11.30pm on Monday, two women, aged 19 and 25, were killed and a 24-year-old woman injured in a shooting in Wallacedene, an informal settlement on Cape Town’s north-eastern edge, South African police said. About 10 minutes later, two other women in their 20s were killed by gunshots to the head in a bedroom in the same area, with police saying the deaths may be linked. The suspected double murders came a day after those of a 20- and 22-year-old, whose genders were not disclosed by police, in neighbouring Eikendal. On 5 September, a man was shot dead at a magistrates court in suspected gang violence, the third killing in a Cape Town court since April. Cape Town is one of the most violent cities in one of the most violent countries in the world. The murder rate in South Africa is behind only Jamaica and Ecuador, according to data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year, Cape Town had the second highest murder rate of any municipality in South Africa, behind Nelson Mandela Bay, and the 16th highest globally, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz, a Mexican NGO. More than 2.4 million people visited Cape Town in 2024, according to city authorities, drawn by its beaches, mountains and nearby vineyards. However, the city is deeply divided between opulent suburbs and the poorer Cape Flats townships, where non-white people were forced to move in the years after the apartheid regime passed the Group Areas Act of 1950. “Our communities are fearful,” Lynn Phillips, from the Cape Flats Safety Forum, told AFP last week at an anti-gang protest. “We don’t have to switch on Netflix to hear gun violence. We sleep, we eat, and we wake up with gun violence.” Western Cape police said last week they were carrying out “targeted operations” in Cape Flats hotspots to seize firearms and ammunition. A statement said: “The message is clear: illegal firearms and those who profit from them have no place in our communities. Our operations will continue without fear or favour, until gangsterism and the violence associated with it are rooted out of the Western Cape.” The acting police minister, Firoz Cachalia, told Cape Flats community members at a meeting on Tuesday that local police did not have the capabilities for “intelligence-driven operations” to successfully tackle gangs and organised crime, local media reported. “There is no proper plan in Cape Town to deal with gang violence in the province,” said Cachalia, who is from the African National Congress party, while Cape Town and the Western Cape are run by their national coalition partners, the Democratic Alliance. More than 26,000 people were murdered in South Africa last year, South African police data shows. Almost 3,500 of those were in Cape Town, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz.",

    "content": "Cheap ultra-processed food behind rise in overweight children, with one in 10 now obese globally, says Unicef More children around the world are obese than underweight for the first time, according to a UN report that warns ultra-processed junk food is overwhelming childhood diets. There are 188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity – one in 10 – Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of life-threatening diseases. Catherine Russell, executive director of the UN agency for children, said: “When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children. “Obesity is a growing concern. Ultra-processed food [UPF] is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health.” While 9.2% of five to 19-year-olds worldwide are underweight, 9.4% are considered obese, the report found. In 2000, nearly 13% were underweight and just 3% were obese. Obesity has overtaken being underweight as the more prevalent form of malnutrition in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and is a problem even in countries with high numbers of children suffering from wasting or stunting due to a lack of food. The report, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children, used data from more than 190 countries and sources including Unicef, the World Health Organization and the World Bank. It revealed that one in five of those aged between five and 19 are overweight, with a growing proportion of those 291 million individuals falling into the obese category: 42% in 2022, up from 30% in 2000. Obesity was highest in Pacific Island countries, where there has been “a shift from traditional diets to cheap, energy-dense, imported food”, the report found. In Niue, 38% of five to 19-year-olds are obese, and the figure is 37% in the Cook Islands. Rates were also high in richer countries, such as Chile (27%), the US (21%) and the United Arab Emirates (21%). In the UK, the percentage of overweight children increased from 29% in 2000 to 30% in 2022, while the percentage with obesity rose from 9% to 11%. The steepest rise in numbers of overweight schoolchildren and teenagers was in low- and middle-income countries, where the number has more than doubled since 2000, amid a corresponding rapid expansion of “modern retail outlets, online grocery stores and food delivery apps”, with UPFs being “relatively cheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious foods”. Childhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life. There is growing international concern about the damaging health impacts of UPFs, which include cereals, biscuits and cakes, fizzy drinks and ready meals, which have been through industrial processes and include additives such as colours, emulsifiers and flavours, and can be high in added sugar, fat or salt. UPFs “dominate shops and schools”, the report warned, and are heavily promoted to young people and parents digitally, creating an environment where they are hard to avoid, rather than a matter of personal choice. Nomathemba Chandiwana, chief scientific officer at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in Cape Town, South Africa, said: “We often only think of malnutrition here as underweight or stunting, but obesity has the same long-term consequences. “About one in eight children are overweight or have obesity, while one in four are stunted. That double burden is shaping a generation’s health,” she said, adding that children were targeted by “relentless” marketing of fast food, even in schools. “It’s really tough trying to tackle both undernutrition and obesity at the same time. South Africa is a middle-income country, but still deeply unequal. Many children grow up both hungry and surrounded by cheap, poor-quality food. “Most of the attention and resources go to undernutrition and stunting in the early years, which of course matters, but obesity isn’t always seen as malnutrition, so it slips under the radar,” she said. Growing rates of childhood obesity will have a major impact economically. The World Obesity Federation has previously estimated that by 2035, the global cost of overweight and obesity will surpass $4tn (£2.9tn) annually. The report highlighted the positive action of Mexico’s ban on the sale and distribution of UPFs in schools. But it added that “the unethical business practices of the ultra-processed food and beverage industry undermine efforts to put legal measures and policies in place to protect children from unhealthy food environments”. Unicef called on governments to act on this by using labelling, marketing restrictions, taxes and subsidies. It suggested banning junk foods and their marketing in schools, and better programmes for vulnerable families to afford nutritious diets. There should be “strong safeguards to protect public-policy processes from interference by the ultra-processed food industry”, it said.",

    "content": "The bossa nova pianist Francisco Tenório Cerqueira Júnior went out for cigarettes after a concert in Buenos Aires – a forensic team has finally revealed his fate Early on 18 March 1976, Francisco Tenório Cerqueira Júnior, a Brazilian pianist who had played alongside some of Latin America’s greatest musicians, disappeared from the streets of Buenos Aires. For nearly 50 years, his fate has remained a mystery, sparking desperate searches, raising suspicions of government complicity, and inspiring international documentaries. Now the mystery has been solved, with forensic scientists formally identifying Tenório Júnior’s body – and confirming he was a victim of Argentina’s bloody dictatorship. “He left his hotel in the centre of the city and the earth ate him,” said Carlos “Maco” Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF). “Nothing more was ever known – until now.” Tenório Júnior, known to most as Tenorinho, was regarded as one of the leading figures of the bossa nova movement – Brazil’s celebrated fusion of samba and jazz. One critic praised him as a pianist with “hands of gold” and an “enormous future”. On 17 March 1976, during a South American tour, he performed alongside the Brazilian legends Vinícius de Moraes and Toquinho at the Gran Rex in Buenos Aires. Around 3am the following morning, the 34-year-old left his downtown hotel in search of cigarettes and aspirin, and was never seen again. In the days that followed, his fellow musicians searched frantically, combing through the hospitals and morgues. Moraes, the lyricist of The Girl from Ipanema, filed a habeas corpus writ and appealed directly to the Brazilian ambassador. By then, Tenorinho, a husband and father of four, was already dead: he had been seized by the Argentinian military and executed, his body dumped in wasteland 30km away. His killing came less than a week before a military coup d’état, which plunged the country into a dark chapter of fear, torture and forced disappearances. Over seven years, tens of thousands of political opponents, student activists, journalists, intellectuals – and countless bystanders – would be abducted, held in clandestine detention centres, tortured and killed. Some were thrown alive from planes, others disposed of in mass graves. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 30,000 people were disappeared. Decades after Tenorinho’s disappearance, at the 2014 National Truth Commission, his widow, Carmen Magalhães Tenório Cerqueira, demanded answers for what happened to her husband. “Where is Tenorinho?” she pressed. “Tenório was a person who never had any involvement with politics. He was a person who lived for music … And what happened to him is really something that … is absurd,” she said. Toquinho channelled his pain into a song called Lembranças, or Memories: “Tenório went out alone into the night / He disappeared / No one could explain.” Over the years, various witnesses came forward; a man working at a newsstand near the hotel said he saw Tenorinho taken away in a green Ford Falcon – the infamous car of choice used by Argentina’s death squads. Official confirmation of what happened would finally come thanks, primarily, to an Argentinian forensic team which to this day excavates and identifies those disappeared by the military regime. The group was originally set up by the Texas forensic anthropologist Dr Clyde Snow – renowned for identifying the skeleton of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele – after Argentina’s return to democracy. They made an unusual team at first; unable to find willing colleagues, with many Argentinians still fearful of a return to the dictatorship, Snow had instead recruited a collection of anthropology students. “None of us were jumping with joy to do this, because if we started to work on this and a new military coup occurred, we would end up on the list of people who could disappear,” said Mercedes “Mimi” Doretti, one of the founders, last year. “But at the same time, we couldn’t say no.” Decades on, the group continues to search for the victims of the dictatorship, scouring archives, interviewing witnesses, corroborating timelines and conducting digs at suspected mass graves. Today, technological advances also have made it possible to conduct mass fingerprint comparisons – the technique that ultimately led to Tenorinho’s discovery. More than 1,500 bodies have been recovered, and more than 840 people identified. “At the same time that the state had been torturing, killing and throwing people from planes, they kept their bureaucratic ways of working, recording deaths, taking fingerprints of the corpses,” said Somigliana, who has worked with the EAAF since 1986. “In many cases, the state tried to avoid this, by burning the bodies, cutting hands off, but in others they left a chain of documents.” While the team had been seeking Tenorinho’s fingerprints for some years, his case gained momentum in 2024, when the office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity found an old file containing the details of a murder victim who had “appeared in a small unoccupied piece of land” in the Tigre district on 20 March 1976. “The death certificate said ‘man with many gunshots, around 30 years old, with a beard’,” said Somigliana. “We compared the fingerprints with all of those people kidnapped in Argentina, and there was no match. Why? Because he was not from Argentina. Then we asked for the fingerprints from Brazil, and when they came, we were able to confirm that this body was him.” Tenorinho’s unnamed body was buried at the Benavídez municipal cemetery on 22 March 1976, but later excavated and put into a common grave. At present, there are no plans to begin exhumations of the common grave. While the identification does not in itself prove the military killed Tenorinho, the manner of his murder and the way his body was discarded mirror the fate of countless others disappeared by the military. His remains were discovered in the same area where other victims of clandestine detention centres had been dumped, cases later proven to be linked directly to the regime. He was also shot more than once, the typical way the military killed victims. While the typical registration of the death – taking the fingerprints and photos of the body – was conducted, his identification was not completed, a further hallmark of state crimes. The EAAF said they had no reason to doubt Tenorinho was a victim of state terrorism in the days before the military coup. Tenorinho, who was born in Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro, was one of 11 Brazilians kidnapped in Argentina during the dictatorship. He had no political affiliations, and it has long been surmised that he was picked up for how he looked: he wore glasses and had a long beard, features the dictatorship associated with leftists. He left behind his wife, Carmen, who was eight months pregnant at the time of his disappearance, and four other children. His parents, who for years sought answers to their son’s whereabouts, died around the 10th anniversary of his murder. His surviving family was informed of the identification this week. Carmen has passed away, along with two of the children. In a statement, the three remaining children said: “We received the news of the identification of our father’s body with surprise, of course, and with a mixture of relief and sadness. Relief because, finally, we can know with more certainty what happened to him in that sad March of 1976. Somehow, we will be closer – saddened by the confirmation that Tenório was a victim of violence and buried as an unknown, far from family, friends, music colleagues.” They said his death deprived them of his company and forced their mother to raise five children alone, one who was born a month after their father’s disappearance. “Tenório never met his youngest son, nor his eight grandchildren,” the children wrote. “We still want and need answers. Who killed Tenório? Why? Why kill a man with no political involvement, who only lived for music?” Tenorinho’s identification comes against an emerging climate of denialism in Argentina. In late 2023, Argentina elected Javier Milei as its president – a hard-right leader who has been accused by rights organisations of attempting to “rewrite the history” of the dictatorship’s crimes. He has previously declared “there were no 30,000” people disappeared, and called into question the extent of the military’s crimes. His party has also begun dismantling the Human Rights Secretariat, downgrading the body and recently laying off hundreds of workers. Last year six lawmakers from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party visited a jail to meet prisoners convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship, including Alfredo Astiz, the so-called “Angel of Death”. The politicians later claimed they were reviewing the living conditions of the detainees. The office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity, nonetheless, is continuing its dictatorship-era work and is reviewing cases involving the discovery of unidentified corpses in public streets in the province of Buenos Aires between 1975 and 1983. “We have already identified approximately 600 files, 475 of which are under analysis,” said María Ángeles Ramos, one of the country’s lead federal prosecutors of dictatorship-era crimes. The EAAF, which operates as a non-profit, is also committed to continuing its work. The team has become world-renowned, finding and identifying remains all over the world including genocide victims in Darfur, and the bodies of the Chilean president Salvador Allende and the guerrilla Che Guevara.",

It is another sign of escalating gang violence that has spread outside the capital. “The secretary-general is alarmed by the levels of violence rocking Haiti and urges the Haitian authorities to ensure that perpetrators of these and all other human rights abuses and violations are brought to justice,” the UN said in a statement. A spokesperson for the national police declined to comment on the alleged killings. Haitian media reported that gangs set Labodrie on fire after the killing of a gang leader who goes by the name Vladimir. He was a member of a gang alliance known as Viv Ansanm that the US declared a terrorist organisation in May. The US state department said the Viv Ansanm alliance was among the primary causes of instability and violence in Haiti. Its members have taken control of large swaths of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and spread to surrounding areas.",

    "content": "News network Milenio releases public apology after US deputy secretary of state threatens to revoke Mexican visas A congressional staffer from Mexico’s ruling party has resigned after being called out online for comments he made on a major Mexican television news program about Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk’s murder. The news network, Milenio, also released a public apology after the United States’ deputy secretary of state – a former ambassador to Mexico – evidently threatened to have Donald Trump’s presidential administration revoke any US visas on which it may count. The episode that unfolded at Milenio continued a trend of people losing their jobs over commentary about Kirk – a self-proclaimed free-speech advocate – deemed offensive by American conservatives, though in this instance it was outside the US. Kirk, a close Trump ally, was shot dead Wednesday while speaking at a university in Utah. Following his death, conservative commentators, activists and public officials in the US have engaged in social media campaigns against people accused of disrespecting Kirk’s memory. A Saturday morning tally by Reuters showed that at least 15 people had been fired or suspended. On Thursday, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state and former US Mexican ambassador, warned on X that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country”. “Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the state department can protect the American people,” said Landau, who was appointed US ambassador to Mexico and served from 2019 to 2021 during Trump’s first presidency. People began responding to Landau’s post with examples of foreign nationals criticizing or making light of Kirk’s death. Among those was a clip of Salvador Ramírez, a social communications coordinator for the ruling Morena party, speaking on a television news program on Milenio. Ramírez appeared on a roundtable political analysis program with Milenio, discussing Kirk’s killing. “I think if Charlie Kirk lived, he may like what I am about to say, because what I am about to say is very ‘anti-woke’,” Ramírez facetiously said. “He was given a spoonful of his own chocolate. They gave a spoonful to someone who promoted the use of weapons. They gave a spoonful to someone who was financed by the National Rifle Association – a political association that is of the extreme right, pro-Trump, of the most radical wing of the Republicans.” Ramírez added that Turning Point USA was “an anti-rights, anti-LGBT – practically anti-women – movement”. After a post tagging Milenio and the Morena party made Landau aware of Ramirez’s comments, he responded with an image reading “El Quitavisas”, roughly meaning “the visa remover”. Minutes later, Landau went after Milenio itself, which is one of the most watched and read news outlets in Mexico. “Really, Milenio? This is the level of ‘discourse’ that you promote on your channel? I am embarrassed for having interacted with you during my tenure as United States ambassador to Mexico,” Landau wrote. Sign up to Headlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Milenio released a public statement on Friday, apologizing for Ramirez’s comments, saying the outlet does not “promote nor accept expressions of hate, violence or disqualification towards any person or group”. “We regret that the remarks made during one of our programs may have upset or offended a part of the audience, and we offer a sincere apology to those who felt offended,” the statement read. Ramirez then released a video on Friday afternoon apologizing for his “very unfortunate” comments, saying they were his own thoughts and not representative of the Morena party nor of Milenio. Later that evening, Ramirez officially announced his resignation from the parliamentary group for the Morena party within the Mexican house of representatives. Others who had similarly lost their jobs or been disciplined at them over commentary about Kirk’s killing have included journalists, academic workers, teachers, nurses a Secret Service employee, a firefighter and a worker for an NFL team. Previously, the Trump administration has targeted people, including students and academic workers, for expressing pro-Palestinian sentiments on social media and for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The FBI announced on Friday that Kirk’s alleged killer had been arrested after a two-day manhunt.",

    "content": "In May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors and the development of nuclear energy technology; the orders aim to cut red tape, ease approval processes, and reshape the role of the main regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.” Self-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through nuclear fission, in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases. The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing 400 gigawatts by 2050. To help achieve that goal, scientific institutions like the Idaho National Laboratory, a leading research institute in nuclear energy, are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel. Companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs, a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector. For example, Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based nuclear power company, plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal. However, the road to renaissance is filled with familiar obstacles. Nuclear energy infrastructure is “too expensive to build, and it takes too long to build,” said Allison Macfarlane, a science and technology policy expert at the University of British Columbia who used to chair the NRC from 2012 to 2014. And experts are divided on whether new nuclear technologies, such as small versions of reactors, are ready for primetime. The nuclear energy field is now “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization that has long acted as a nuclear safety watchdog. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy by weakening the NRC, Lyman said. “The message is that it's regulation that has been the obstacle to deploying nuclear power, and if we just get rid of all this red tape, then the industry is going to thrive,” he added. “I think that's really misplaced.” Although streamlining the approval process might accelerate development, the true problem lies in the high costs of nuclear, which would need to be significantly cheaper to compete with other sources of energy such as natural gas, said Koroush Shirvan, a nuclear science researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Even the license-ready reactors are still not economical,” he said. If the newer reactor technologies do pan out, without government support and subsidies, Shirvan said, it is difficult to imagine them “coming online before 2035.” Rumblings of a nuclear renaissance give experts a sense of déjà vu. The first resurgence in interest was around 2005, when many thought that nuclear energy could mitigate climate change and be an energy alternative to dwindling supply and rising prices of fossil fuels. But that enthusiasm slowed mainly after the Fukushima accident in 2011, in which a tsunami-triggered power outage—along with multiple safety failures—led to a nuclear meltdown at a facility in Japan. “So, the first nuclear renaissance fizzled out,” said Lyman. Globally, the proportion of electricity provided by nuclear energy has been dwindling. Although there has been an increase in generation, nuclear energy has contributed less to the share of global electricity demand, dropping to 9 percent in 2024 from a peak of about 17 percent in 2001. In the US, 94 reactors generate about a fifth of the nation’s electricity, a proportion that has held steady since 1990s. But only two of those reactors have come online in the last nearly 30 years. This renewed push is “a second bite at the apple, and we’ll have to see but it does seem to have a lot more of a headwind now,” said Lyman. Much of that movement comes from the private sector, said Todd Allen, a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan. In the last couple of decades, dozens of nuclear energy companies have emerged, including TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates. “It feels more like normal capitalism than we ever had in nuclear,” Allen said. Those companies are working on developing the large reactors that have been the backbone of nuclear energy for decades, as well as newer technologies that can bolster the field. Proponents say small modular reactors, or SMRs, and microreactors, which generate less than 300 megawatts and 20 megawatts, respectively, could offer safer, cheaper, and more flexible energy compared to their more traditional counterparts. (Large reactors have, on average, 900 megawatts of capacity.) One 2022 study found that modularization can reduce construction time by up to 60 percent. These designs have taken the spotlight: In 2024, a report estimated that the SMR market would reach $295 billion by 2043. In June, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Congress that DOE will have at least three SMRs running by July of next year. And in July of this year, the Nuclear Energy Agency launched a dashboard to track SMR technologies around the world, which identified 74 SMR designs at different stages around the world. The first commercial SMR in North America is currently being constructed in Canada, with plans to be operational by 2030. But whether SMRs and microreactors are actually safer and more cost-effective remains to be determined. A 2022 study found that SMRs would likely produce more leakage and nuclear waste than conventional reactors. Studying them, though, is difficult since so few are currently operational. In part, that may be because of cost. Multiple analyses have concluded that, because of rising construction and operating costs, SMRs might not be financially viable enough to compete for the world’s energy markets, including in developing countries that lack affordable access to electricity. And recent ventures have hit road bumps: For example, NuScale, the only SMR developer with a design approved by the NRC, had to shut down its operations in November 2023 due to increasingly high costs (though another uprated SMR design was approved earlier this year). “Nothing is really commercialized yet,” said Macfarlane. Most of the tech companies haven’t figured out expenses, supply chains, the kind of waste they are going to produce or security at their reactors, she added. Fuel supply is also a barrier since most plants use uranium enriched at low rates, but SMRs and microreactors use uranium enriched at higher levels, which is typically sourced from Russia and not commercially available in the US. So scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory are working to recover enriched uranium from existing reactors and developed new, more cost-effective fuels, said Jess Gehin, the associate laboratory director for the Nuclear Science & Technology Directorate at the INL. They are also using artificial intelligence and modeling simulation tools and capabilities to optimize nuclear energy systems, he added: “We got to reach 400 gigawatts, we need to accelerate all of this.” Companies are determined to face and surpass these barriers. Some have begun pouring concrete, such as one nuclear company called Kairos Power that began building a demo of their SMR design in Tennessee; the plant is projected to be fully operational by 2027. “I would make the case that we're moving faster than many in the field, if not the fastest,” Mike Laufer, the company’s CEO and co-founder, told Reuters last year. Some experts think achieving nuclear expansion can be done—and revel in the progress so far: “I would have never thought we'd be in this position where we're working so hard to expand nuclear, because for most of my career, it wasn't that way,” said Gehin. “And I would say each month that goes by exceeds my expectations on the next bigger things that are coming.\" Although the Trump administration aims to accelerate nuclear energy through executive orders, in practice, it has not allocated new funding yet, said Matt Bowen, an expert on nuclear energy, waste, and nonproliferation at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In fact, the initial White House budget proposed cutting $4.7 billion from the Department of Energy, including $408 million from the Office of Nuclear Energy allocated for nuclear research in the 2026 fiscal year. “The administration was proposing cuts to Office of Nuclear Energy and DOE more broadly, and DOGE is pushing staff out,” said Bowen. “How do you do more with less? Less staff, less money.” The Trump administration places the blame for the nuclear sector’s stagnation on the NRC, which oversees licensing and recertification processes that cost the industry millions of dollars each year in compliance. In his executive orders, Trump called for a major reorganization of the NRC. Some of the proposed changes, like streamlining the approval process (which can take years for new plants), may be welcomed because “for a long time, they were very, very, very slow,” said Charles Forsberg, a nuclear chemical engineer at MIT. But there are worries that the executive orders could do more than cut red tape. “Every word in those orders is of concern, because the thrust of those orders is to essentially strip the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of its independence from the executive branch, essentially nullifying the original purpose,” said Lyman. Some experts fear that with these new constraints, NRC staff will have less time and fewer resources to do their jobs, which could impact power plant safety in the future. Bowen said: “This notion that the problem for nuclear energy is regulation, and so all we need to do is deregulate, is both wrong and also really problematic.” The next few decades will tell whether nuclear, especially SMRs, can overcome economic and technical challenges to safely contribute to decarbonization efforts. Some, like Gehin, are optimistic. “I think we're going to accelerate,” he said. “We certainly can achieve a dramatic deployment if we put our mindset to it.” But making nuclear financially competitive will take serious commitment from the government and the dozens of companies, with many still skeptical, Shirvan said. “I am quite, I would say, on the pessimistic scale when it comes to the future of nuclear energy in the US.” This article was originally published on Undark.

    "content": "Six decades have now passed since some of the most iconic Project Gemini spaceflights. The 60th anniversary of Gemini 4, when Ed White conducted the first US spacewalk, came in June. The next mission, Gemini 5, ended just two weeks ago, in 1965. These missions are now forgotten by most Americans, as most of the people alive during that time are now deceased. However, during these early years of spaceflight, NASA engineers and astronauts cut their teeth on a variety of spaceflight firsts, flying a series of harrowing missions during which it seems a miracle that no one died. Because the Gemini missions, as well as NASA's first human spaceflight program Mercury, yielded such amazing stories, I was thrilled to realize that a new book has recently been published—Gemini & Mercury Remastered—that brings them back to life in vivid color. The book is a collection of 300 photographs from NASA's Mercury and Gemini programs during the 1960s, in which Andy Saunders has meticulously restored the images and then deeply researched their background to more fully tell the stories behind them. The end result is a beautiful and powerful reminder of just how brave America's first pioneers in space were. What follows is a lightly edited conversation with Saunders about how he developed the book and some of his favorite stories from it. Ars: Why put out a book on Mercury and Gemini now? Andy Saunders: Well, it's the 60th anniversaries of the Gemini missions, but the book is really the prequel to my first book, Apollo Remastered. This is about the missions that came before. So it takes us right back to the very dawn of human space exploration, back to the very beginning, and this was always a project I was going to work on next. Because, as well as being obviously very important in spaceflight history, they're very important in terms of human history, the human evolution, even, you know, the first time we were able to escape Earth. For tens of thousands of years, civilizations have looked up and dreamt of leaving Earth and voyaging to the stars. And this golden era in the early 1960s is when that ancient dream finally became a reality. Also, of course, the first opportunity to look back at Earth and give us that unique perspective. But I think it's really the photographs specifically that will just forever symbolize and document at the beginning of our expansion out into the cosmos. You know, of course, we went to the Moon with Apollo. We'll go back with Artemis. We spent long periods on the International Space Station. We'll walk on Mars. We'll eventually become a multi-planetary species. But this is where it all began and how it all began. Ars: They used modified Hasselblad cameras during Apollo to capture these amazing images. What types of cameras were used during Mercury and Gemini? Saunders: Mercury was more basic cameras. So on the very first missions, NASA didn't want the astronaut to take a camera on board. The capsules were tiny. They were very busy. They're very short missions, obviously very groundbreaking missions. So, the first couple of missions, there was a camera out of the porthole window, just taking photographs automatically. But it was John Glenn on his mission (Mercury-Atlas 6) who said, \"No, I want to take a camera. People want to know what it's going to be like to be an astronaut. They're going to want to look at Earth through the window. I'm seeing things no humans ever seen before.\" So he literally saw a $40 camera in a drugstore on his way after a haircut at Cocoa Beach. He thought, \"That's perfect.\" And he bought it himself, and then NASA adapted it. They put a pistol grip on to help him to use it. And with it, he took the first still photographs of Earth from space. So it was the early astronauts that kind of drove the desire to take cameras themselves, but they were quite basic. Wally Schirra (Mercury-Atlas 8) then took the first Hasselblad. He wanted medium format, better quality, but really, the photographs from Mercury aren't as stunning as Gemini. It's partly the windows and the way they took the photos, and they'd had little experience. Also, preservation clearly wasn't high up on the agenda in Mercury, because the original film is evidently in a pretty bad state. The first American in space is an incredibly important moment in history. But every single frame of the original film of Alan Shepard's flight was scribbled over with felt pen, it's torn, and it's fixed with like a piece of sticky tape. But it's a reminder that these weren't taken for their aesthetic quality. They weren't taken for posterity. You know, they were technical information. The US was trying to catch up with the Soviets. Preservation wasn't high up on the agenda. Ars: I want to understand your process. How many photos did you consider for this book? Saunders: With Apollo, they took about 35,000 photographs. With Mercury and Gemini, there were about 5,000. Which I was quite relieved about. So yeah, I went through all 5,000 they took. I'm not sure how much 16 millimeter film in terms of time, because it was at various frame rates, but a lot of 16 millimeter film. So I went through every frame of film that was captured from launch to splashdown on every mission. Ars: Out of that material, how much did you end up processing? Saunders: What I would first do is have a quick look, particularly if there's apparently nothing in them, because a lot of them are very underexposed. But with digital processing, like I did with the cover of the Apollo book, we can pull out stuff that you actually can't see in the raw file. So it's always worth taking a look. So do a very quick edit, and then if it's not of interest, it's discarded. Or it might be that clearly an important moment was happening, even if it's not a particularly stunning photograph, I would save that one. So I was probably down from 5,000 to maybe 800, and then do a better edit on it. And then the final 300 that are in the book are those that are either aesthetically stunning, or they're a big transformation, or they show something important that happened on the mission, or a historically significant moment. But also, what I want to do with the book, as well as showing the photographs, is tell the stories, these incredible human stories that, because of the risks they were taking. So to do that, I effectively reconstructed every mission from launch to splashdown by using lots of different pieces of information in order to effectively map the photography onto a timeline so that it can then tell the story through the captions. So a photograph might be in there simply to help tell part of the story. Ars: What was your favorite story to tell? Saunders: Well, perhaps in terms of a chapter and a mission, I'd say Gemini 4 is kind of the heart of the book. You know, first US space walk, quite a lot of drama occurred when they couldn't close the hatch. There's some quite poignant shots, particularly of Ed White, of course, who later lost his life in the Apollo 1 fire. But in terms of the story, I mean, Gemini 9A was just, there needs to be a movie about just Gemini 9A. Right from the start, from losing the prime crew, and then just what happened out on Gene Cernan's EVA, how he got back into the capsule alive is quite incredible, and all this detail I've tried to cover because he took his camera. So he called it the spacewalk from hell. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. He was incredibly exhausted, overheated. His visor steamed over. He went effectively blind, and he was at the back of the adapter section. This is at a point when NASA just hadn't mastered EVA. So, simply how you maneuver in space, they just haven't mastered, so he was exhausted. He was almost blind. Then he lost communication with Tom Stafford, his command pilot. He tore his suit, because, of course, back then, there were all kinds of jagged parts on the spacecraft. And then when he's finally back in the hatch, he was quite a big chap, and they couldn't close the hatch, so he was bent double trying to close the hatch. He started to see stars. He said, Tom, if we don't close this hatch now and re-pressurize, I am going to die. They got it closed, got his helmet off, and Tom Stafford said he just looked like someone that had spent far too long in a sauna. Stafford sprayed him with a water hose to kind of cool him down. So what happened on that mission is just quite incredible. But there was something on every mission, you know, from Gus Grissom sinking of the Liberty Bell and him almost drowning, the heat shield coming loose, or an indicator that suggested the heat shield was loose on Glenn's mission. There's an image of that in the book. Like I said, I mapped everything to the timeline, and worked out the frame rates, and we've got the clock we can see over his shoulder. So I could work out exactly when he was at the point of maximum heating through reentry, when part of the strapping that kept the retro pack on, to try and hold a heat shield on that hit the window, and he's talking, but no one was listening, because it was during radio blackout. The process I used for this, on the low-quality 16 mm film, was to stack hundreds and hundreds of frames to bring out incredible detail. You can almost see the pores in his skin. To see this level of detail, to me, it's just like a portrait of courage. There he is, holding steadfast, not knowing if he's about to burn up in the atmosphere. So that was quite a haunting image, if you like, to be able to help you step on board, you know, these tiny Mercury spacecraft, to see them, to see what they saw, to look out the windows and see how they saw it. Ars: What was new or surprising to you as you spent so much time with these photos and looking at the details? Saunders: The human side to them. Now that we can see them this clearly, they seem to have an emotional depth to them. And it's that level of risk that they were taking. I think that's what really hit home. The Earth shots are stunning. You know, you can almost feel the scale, particularly with a super wide lens, and the altitudes they flew to. And you can just imagine what it must have been like out on an EVA, for example. I think Gene Cernan said it was like sitting on God's front porch, the view he had on his EVA. So those Earth shots are stunning, but it's really those the human side that really hits home for me. I read every word of every transcript of every mission. All the conversations were recorded on tape between the air and the ground, and between the astronauts when they were out of ground contact, and reading those it really hits home what they were doing. I found myself holding my breath, and, you know, my shoulders were stiff. Ars: So what's next? I mean, there's only about 100 million photos from the Space Shuttle era. Saunders: Thankfully, they weren't all taken on film. So if I wanted to complete space on film, then what I haven't yet done is Apollo-Soyuz, Skylab, and the first, whatever it is, 20 percent of the shuttle. So maybe that's next. But I would just like a rest, because I've been doing this now since the middle of 2019, literally nonstop. It's all I've done with Apollo and now Mercury and Gemini. The books make a really nice set in that they're exactly the same size. So it covers the first view of the curvature of Earth and space right through to our last steps on the Moon.",

    "content": "Federal funding is about to run out for 19 active space missions studying Earth's climate, exploring the Solar System, and probing mysteries of the Universe. This year's budget expires at the end of this month, and Congress must act before October 1 to avert a government shutdown. If Congress passes a budget before then, it will most likely be in the form of a continuing resolution, an extension of this year's funding levels into the first few weeks or months of fiscal year 2026. The White House's budget request for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 25 percent cut to NASA's overall budget, and a nearly 50 percent reduction in funding for the agency's Science Mission Directorate. These cuts would cut off money for at least 41 missions, including 19 already in space and many more far along in development. Normally, a president's budget request isn't the final say on matters. Lawmakers in the House and Senate have written their own budget bills in the last several months. There are differences between each appropriations bill, but they broadly reject most of the Trump administration's proposed cuts. Still, this hasn't quelled the anxieties of anyone with a professional or layman's interest in space science. The 19 active robotic missions chosen for cancellation are operating beyond their original design lifetime. However, in many cases, they are in pursuit of scientific data that no other mission has a chance of collecting for decades or longer. Some of the mission names are recognizable to anyone with a passing interest in NASA's work. They include the agency's two Orbiting Carbon Observatory missions monitoring data signatures related to climate change, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which survived a budget scare last year, and two of NASA's three active satellites orbiting Mars. And there's New Horizons, a spacecraft that made front-page headlines in 2015 when it beamed home the first up-close pictures of Pluto. Another mission on the chopping block is Juno, the world's only spacecraft currently at Jupiter. Both spacecraft have more to offer, according to the scientists leading the missions. “New Horizons is perfectly healthy,\" said Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator at Southwest Research Institute (SWRI). \"Everything on the spacecraft is working. All the spacecraft subsystems are performing perfectly, as close to perfectly as one could ever hope. And all the instruments are, too. The spacecraft has the fuel and power to run into the late 2040s or maybe 2050.\" New Horizons is a decade and more than 2.5 billion miles (4.1 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto. The probe flew by a frozen object named Arrokoth on New Year's Day 2019, returning images of the most distant world ever explored by a spacecraft. Since then, the mission has continued its speedy departure from the Solar System and could become the third spacecraft to return data from interstellar space. New Horizons cost taxpayers $780 million from the start of development through the end of its primary mission after exploring Pluto. The project received $9.7 million from NASA to cover operations costs in 2024, the most recent year with full budget data. It's unlikely New Horizons will be able to make another close flyby of an object like it did with Pluto and Arrokoth. But the science results keep rolling in. Just last year, scientists announced the news that New Horizons found the Kuiper Belt—a vast outer zone of hundreds of thousands of small, icy worlds beyond the orbit of Neptune—might extend much farther out than previously thought. \"We're waiting for government, in the form of Congress, the administration, to come up with a funding bill for FY26, which will tell us if our mission is on the chopping block or not,\" Stern said. \"The administration's proposal is to cancel essentially every extended mission ... So, we're not being singled out, but we would get caught in that.\" Stern, who served as head of NASA's science division in 2007 and 2008, said the surest way to prevent the White House's cuts is for Congress to pass a budget with specific instructions for the Trump administration. \"The administration ultimately will make some decision based on what Congress does,\" Stern said. \"If Congress passes a continuing resolution, then that opens a whole lot of other possibilities where the administration could do something without express direction from Congress. We're just going to have to see where we end up at the end of September and then in the fall.\" Stern said shutting down so many of NASA's science missions would be a \"tragic capitulation of US leadership\" and \"fiscally irresponsible.\" \"We’re pretty undeniably the frontrunner, and have been for decades, in space sciences,\" Stern said. \"There's much more money in overruns than there is in what it costs to run these missions—I mean, dramatically. And yet, by cutting overruns, you don't affect our leadership position. Turning off spacecraft would put us in third or fourth place, depending on who you talk to, behind the Chinese and the Europeans at least, and maybe behind others.\" Stern resigned his job as NASA's science chief in 2008 after taking a similar stance arguing against cuts to healthy projects and research grants to cover overruns in other programs, according to a report in Science Magazine. Juno, meanwhile, has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016, collecting information on the giant planet's internal structure, magnetic field, and atmosphere. “Everything is functional,\" said Scott Bolton, the lead scientist on Juno, also from SWRI. \"There's been some degradation, things that we saw many years ago, but those haven't changed. Actually, some of them improved, to be honest.\" The only caveat with Juno is some radiation damage to its camera, called JunoCam. Juno orbits Jupiter once every 33 days, and the trajectory brings the spacecraft through intense radiation belts trapped by the planet's powerful magnetic field. Juno's primary mission ended in 2021, and it's now operating in an extended mission approved through the end of this month. The additional time exposed to harsh radiation is, not surprisingly, corrupting JunoCam's images. In an interview with Ars, Bolton suggested the radiation issue creates another opportunity for NASA to learn from the Juno mission. Ground teams are attempting to repair the JunoCam imager through annealing, a self-healing process that involves heating the instrument's electronics and then allowing them to cool. Engineers sparingly tried annealing hardware space, so Juno's experience could be instructive for future missions. \"Even satellites at Earth experience this [radiation damage], but there's very little done or known about it,\" Bolton said. \"In fact, what we're learning with Juno has benefits for Earth satellites, both commercial and national security.\" Juno's passages through Jupiter's harsh radiation belts provide a real-world laboratory to experiment with annealing in space. \"We can't really produce the natural radiation environment at Earth or Jupiter in a lab,\" Bolton said. Lessons learned from Juno could soon be applied to NASA's next probe traveling to Jupiter. Europa Clipper launched last year and is on course to enter orbit around Jupiter in 2030, when it will begin regular low-altitude flybys of the planet's icy moon Europa. Before Clipper's launch, engineers discovered a flaw that could make the spacecraft's transistors more susceptible to radiation damage. NASA managers decided to proceed with the mission because they determined the damage could be repaired at Jupiter with annealing. \"So, we have rationale to hopefully continue Juno because of science, national security, and it sort of fits in the goals of exploration as well, because you have high radiation even in these translunar orbits [heading to the Moon],\" Bolton said. \"Learning about how to deal with that and how to build spacecraft better to survive that, and how to repair them, is really an interesting twist that we came by on accident, but nevertheless, turns out to be really important.\" It cost $28.4 million to operate Juno in 2024, compared to NASA's $1.13 billion investment to build, launch, and fly the spacecraft to Jupiter. “We're hoping everything's going to keep going,\" Bolton said. \"We put in a proposal for three years. The science is potentially very good. ... But it’s sort of unknown. We just are waiting to hear and waiting for direction from NASA, and we're watching all of the budget scenarios, just like everybody else, in the news.\" NASA headquarters earlier this year asked Stern and Bolton, along with teams leading other science missions coming under the ax, for an outline of what it would take and what it would cost to \"close out\" their projects. \"We sent something that was that was a sketch of what it might look like,\" Bolton said. A \"closeout\" would be irreversible for at least some of the 19 missions at risk of termination. \"Termination doesn't just mean shutting down the contract and sending everybody away, but it's also turning the spacecraft off,\" Stern said. \"And when you turn off those spacecraft’s radio receivers, there's no way to turn them back on because they're off. They can never get a command in. \"So, if we change our mind, we've had another election, or had some congressional action, anything like that, it’s really terminating the spacecraft, and there’s no going back.\"",

    "content": "Under ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr, federal health officials are working to link COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to the deaths of 25 children, and may further restrict access to the shots, possibly recommending them for people aged 75 and up, instead of 65 and up, according to The Washington Post. Four unnamed sources close to the situation told the Post that Trump administration health officials appear to be using information from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to make the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed children. VAERS is a system in which anyone can report anything they think is an adverse event related to a vaccination. The reports are completely unverified upon submission, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff follow up on serious reports to try to substantiate claims and assess if they were actually caused by a vaccine. They rarely are. Federal health experts continuously monitor VAERS and other safety surveillance systems, exhaustively assessing the safety of vaccines. After billions of COVID-19 doses have been administered worldwide, they—like other governments, health organizations, and academic researchers around the world—have found the shots to be remarkably safe. While they have been linked to a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart and surrounding tissue, respectively), that risk is low and the cases are generally mild. During the 2023–2024 COVID-19 season, the incidence rate of heart conditions was 27 cases per million doses for males aged 12 to 24, who have the highest risk of any group. The shots have not been linked to deaths or heart transplants, according to data presented by staff experts at the CDC. Generally, among people of all ages, death rates were lower for those vaccinated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines than in the general population. Meanwhile, 25 children died of COVID-19—the disease, not the vaccine—since July 2023. Of those 25 children, 16 were old enough to get vaccinated, but 14 had no record of getting a vaccine, and none were up-to-date on their vaccines. Still, Kennedy has a long-established disdain for the mRNA vaccines. In 2021, at the height of the pandemic, Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to revoke authorization of COVID-19 vaccines and refrain from approving any future COVID-19 vaccines. He has since repeatedly spread false information about the vaccine, including claiming, without evidence, that they have caused the death of children and are \"the deadliest vaccine[s] ever made.\" In making those comments, Kennedy has pointed to VAERS as his data source. Now that Kennedy is Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), he has continued his anti-vaccine agenda and diligently installed allies in federal health agencies who share his anti-vaccine, anti-science, and anti-public health views. For instance, last month, Kennedy canceled nearly $500 million in grants that supported developing mRNA vaccines to prevent the next pandemic. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 highly qualified and respected experts on a vaccine advisory panel for the CDC—the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—which sets the vaccine standards and insurance coverage for the country. Kennedy quickly restocked ACIP with hand-selected members who share his contempt for mRNA vaccines and pandemic policies. He's currently considering adding more such members. Kennedy's ACIP is scheduled to meet next week, September 18 and 19, to discuss COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the Hepatitis B vaccine, the measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (MMRV) vaccine, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). While the new members could vote to further restrict access to any of those safe, lifesaving vaccines, most of the focus has been on COVID-19 vaccine access. That access is currently in chaos due to new restrictions and a lack of updated ACIP recommendations, which are usually made earlier in the year. Under Kennedy, the FDA restricted access to the vaccines, changing the product approvals from being available to everyone ages 6 months and up to now only being approved for those 65 and older, and those under 64 who have a medical condition that puts them at a higher risk of COVID-19. While some experts and health care providers had hoped that next week's ACIP meeting would add clarity to the situation and allow healthy adults and children better access to the shots, the Post's reporting suggests that's unlikely. According to their sources, Kennedy's ACIP is considering recommending the vaccines to those 75 and older, while instructing those 74 and younger to speak with their doctor about getting a shot. Another reported option is to not recommend the vaccine to people under the age of 75 at all, unless they have a preexisting condition. Such additional restrictions would likely intensify the backlash against Kennedy's anti-vaccine agenda. Already, medical organizations have taken the unprecedented action to release their own evidence-based guidances that maintain COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children, particularly those under age 2, pregnant people, and healthy adults. Many medical and health organizations, as well as lawmakers, and over 1,000 current and former HHS employees have also called for Kennedy to resign. Criticism of Kennedy's actions has spread across party lines. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a vaccine-supporting physician who cast a critical vote for Kennedy's confirmation, had accused Kennedy of denying people vaccines and called for next week's ACIP meeting to be postponed. “Serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting,\" Cassidy said. \"These decisions directly impact children’s health, and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted. If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.\" Meanwhile, in a clear rebuff of Kennedy's cancellation of mRNA vaccine funding, the Republican-led House Committee on Appropriations this week passed a 2026 spending bill that was specifically amended to inject the words \"including of mRNA vaccines\" into a sentence about pandemic preparedness funding. The bill now reads: \"$1,100,000,000, to remain available through September 30, 2027, shall be for expenses necessary to support advanced research and development, including of mRNA vaccines, pursuant to section 319L of the PHS Act and other administrative expenses of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\"",

    "content": "When software engineer Joshua Fonseca recently connected the GameCube simulation classic Animal Crossing to a modern AI language model like the kind that powers ChatGPT, he decided to shake things up. By programming the AI to roleplay as villagers growing aware of their debt situation, and giving them a shared memory to track conversations, Fonseca orchestrated a scenario where the residents began to organize against their raccoon landlord. In Animal Crossing, Tom Nook runs the town shop and provides home loans (paid out in bells, the in-game currency) that keep players perpetually in debt, which is a core mechanic of the game. \"Predictably, it escalated into an anti-Tom Nook movement,\" Fonseca wrote in a detailed post documenting his hack that bridges a 2002 game to cloud-based AI without modifying any game code. While Fonseca frames the uprising as a type of emergent phenomenon in his post and a YouTube video, examination of the source code by AI researcher Simon Willison shows that Fonseca specifically instructed the villagers to behave this way and even escalate the unrest over time. \"You are a resident of a town run by Tom Nook. You are beginning to realize your mortgage is exploitative and the economy is unfair,\" reads the initial prompt. \"Discuss this with the player and other villagers when appropriate.\" Even though Fonseca stacked the deck, so to speak, it's still an interesting technical hack. After connecting the simulated villagers to a real-world newsfeed to provide context, characters began relating headlines in casual conversation, which the developer found surreal. One villager named Mitzi suddenly announced, \"About the news? European leaders are planning to meet with Trump and Zelenskyy!\" Another delivered a humorous simulation of self-awareness: \"Oh my gosh, Josh! I just had the weirdest dream, like, everything we do is a game! Arfer!\" As amusing as this type of mod is, it's worth remembering that large language models are always playing roles prompted by humans, pulling statistically plausible outputs from training data that researchers fed into their neural networks when they created or later fine-tuned them. Making this amusing amalgam of past and present technology possible required some clever engineering. The technical feat Fonseca pulled off involves a Python script that monitors the game memory through the Dolphin emulator, sends dialogue context to AI models like GPT-5 or Gemini, and writes the responses back into the GameCube's RAM. The GameCube presented unique obstacles for this project. With its 485 MHz PowerPC processor, 24MB of RAM, and no Internet connectivity (unless you add the Modem or Broadband Adapter), the console was \"fundamentally, physically, and philosophically designed to be an offline island,\" Fonseca notes. His timing proved fortunate. The Animal Crossing decompilation community had just finished reverse-engineering the game's source code, providing readable C instead of PowerPC assembly. This gave him access to the dialogue system's inner workings through a file called m_message.c. (He considered using the Broadband Adapter, but it would have added many layers of additional complexity to the project.) Rather than write an entire network stack for the GameCube from scratch, Fonseca implemented what he calls a \"memory mailbox.\" This classic game modding technique uses specific RAM addresses as communication channels. His Python script writes directly to GameCube memory through Dolphin while the game reads from those same locations. Finding these addresses required what Fonseca describes as becoming a \"memory archaeologist.\" He wrote a custom scanner and spent hours in a loop: talk to a villager, freeze the emulator when dialogue appeared, scan all 24 million bytes of RAM for the text string, then cross-reference with different villagers. He eventually located the speaker's name and dialogue buffer at specific addresses. But discovering the addresses was only half the problem. When you talk to a villager in Animal Crossing, the game normally displays dialogue instantly. Calling an AI model over the Internet takes several seconds. Willison examined the code and found Fonseca's solution: a watch_dialogue() function that polls memory 10 times per second. When it detects a conversation starting, it immediately writes placeholder text: three dots with hidden pause commands between them, followed by a \"Press A to continue\" prompt. \"So the user gets a 'press A to continue' button and hopefully the LLM has finished by the time they press that button,\" Willison noted in a Hacker News comment. While players watch dots appear and reach for the A button, the mod races to get a response from the AI model and translate it into the game's dialog format. Simply writing text to memory froze the game. Animal Crossing uses an encoded format with control codes that manage everything from text color to character emotions. A special prefix byte (0x7F) signals commands rather than characters. Without the proper end-of-conversation control code, the game waits forever. \"Think of it like HTML,\" Fonseca explains. \"Your browser doesn't just display words; it interprets tags ... to make text bold.\" The decompilation community had documented these codes, allowing Fonseca to build encoder and decoder tools that translate between a human-readable format and the GameCube's expected byte sequences. Initially, he tried using a single AI model to handle both creative writing and technical formatting. \"The results were a mess,\" he notes. \"The AI was trying to be a creative writer and a technical programmer simultaneously and was bad at both.\" The solution: split the work between two models. A Writer AI creates dialogue using character sheets scraped from the Animal Crossing fan wiki. A Director AI then adds technical elements, including pauses, color changes, character expressions, and sound effects. The code is available on GitHub, though Fonseca warns it contains known bugs and has only been tested on macOS. The mod requires Python 3.8+, API keys for either Google Gemini or OpenAI, and Dolphin emulator. Have fun sticking it to the man—or the raccoon, as the case may be.",

    "content": "While the Trump administration has continued to refer to efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change as a scam, it has done almost nothing to counter the copious scientific evidence that demonstrates that climate change is real and doing real damage to the citizens of the US. The lone exception has been a draft Department of Energy report prepared by a handful of carefully chosen fringe figures that questioned the mainstream understanding of climate change. The shoddy work and questionable conclusions of that report were so extensive that an analysis of it required over 450 pages to detail all of its shortcomings. But its shortcomings may not have been limited to the science, as a lawsuit alleges that its preparation violated a law that regulates the activities of federal advisory panels. Now, in an attempt to avoid dealing with that lawsuit, the Department of Energy is claiming that it dissolved the committee that prepared the report, making the lawsuit moot. Meanwhile, Congress is also attempting to muddy the waters. In response to the DOE report, the National Academies of Science announced that it would prepare a report describing the current state of climate science. Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight have responded by announcing an investigation of the National Academies \"for undermining the EPA.\" As we noted in our original coverage, the members of the advisory group that prepared the DOE report were carefully chosen for having views that are well outside the mainstream of climate science. Based on their past public statements, they could be counted on to produce a report that would question the severity of climate change and raise doubts about whether we had any evidence it was happening. The report they produced went beyond that by suggesting that the net effect of our carbon emissions was likely to be a positive for humanity. Not only was that shoddy science, but a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists suggested that it was likely illegal. Groups like the one that wrote the report, the suit alleges, fall under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which (among other things) dictates that these groups must be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented,\" rather than be selected in order to reinforce a single point of view. The \"among other things\" that the law dictates is that the advisory groups have public meetings that are announced in advance, be chartered with a well-defined mission, and all of their records be made available to the public. In contrast, nobody within the Department of Energy, including the contrarians who wrote the report, acknowledged the work they were doing publicly until the day the draft report was released. The suit alleges that the work of this group fell under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and the group violated the act in all of the above ways and more. The act asks the courts to force the DOE to disclose all the relevant records involved with the preparation of the report, and to cease relying on it for any regulatory actions. That's significant because the Environmental Protection Agency cited it in its attempts to roll back its prior finding that greenhouse gases posed a danger to the US public. This week, the DOE responded in court by claiming the panel that produced the report had been dissolved, making the suit moot. That does not address the fact that the EPA is continuing to rely on the report in its attempts to argue there's no point in regulating greenhouse gases. It also leaves the report itself in a weird limbo. Its release marked the start of a period of public comment, and said comments were supposed to be considered during the revisions that would take place before the draft was finalized. Failure to complete the revision process would leave the EPA vulnerable to claims that it's relying on an incomplete draft report for its scientific justifications. So, while the DOE's tactics may protect some of its internal documents, it may ultimately cause larger problems for the Trump administration's agenda. Earlier this year, we were critical of the US's National Academies of Science for seemingly refusing to respond to the Trump administration's attacks on science. That reticence appeared to end in August with the release of the DOE climate report and the announcement that the EPA was using that report as the latest word on climate science, which it argued had changed considerably since the initial EPA decisions on this issue in 2009. In response, the National Academies announced that it would fast-track a new analysis of the risks posed by greenhouse gases, this one done by mainstream scientists instead of a handful of fringe figures. The goal was to get it done before the EPA closed its public comment period on its proposal to ignore greenhouse gases. Obviously, this poses a threat to the EPA's planned actions, which apparently prompted Republicans in Congress to step in. Earlier this month, the chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), announced he was investigating the National Academies for preparing this report, calling it \"a blatant partisan act to undermine the Trump Administration.\" Comer has also sent a letter to the National Academies, outlining his concerns and demanding a variety of documents. Some of these are pretty convoluted: \"The study is led by a National Academies member who serves as an external advisor to the Science Philanthropy Alliance, which has ties to the left-wing group Arabella Advisors through the New Venture Fund, an organization that promotes a variety of progressive causes and funds major climate litigation,\" Comer says, suggesting ... it's not entirely clear what. Another member of the study panel had the audacity to endorse former President Biden for his climate policies. Separately, Comer says he's concerned about the source of the funds that will pay for this study. Some of Comer's demands are consistent with this, focusing on funding for this review. But he goes well beyond that, demanding a list of all the National Academies' sources of funding, as well as any internal communications about this study. He's also going on a bit of a witch hunt within the federal government, demanding any communications the NAS has had with government employees regarding the DOE's report or the EPA's greenhouse gas decisions. It's pretty clear that Comer recognizes that any unbiased presentation of climate science is going to undercut the EPA's rationale for reversing course on greenhouse gas regulations. So, he's preparing in advance to undercut that presentation by claiming it's rife with conflicts of interest—and he's willing to include \"supporting politicians who want to act on climate change\" as a conflict. All of this maneuvering is taking place before the EPA has even finalized its planned U-turn on greenhouse gases, a step that will undoubtedly trigger additional investigations and lawsuits. In many ways, this is likely to reflect many of these parties laying the groundwork for the legal fight to come. And, while some of this is ostensibly about the state of the science that has supported the EPA's past policy decisions, it's clear that the administration and its supporters are doing their best to minimize science's impact on their preferred course of action.",

    "content": "The conservative broadcaster/provocateur Charlie Kirk—murdered this week during a visit to a Utah college—had tweeted some life advice this summer: \"When things are moving very fast and people are losing their minds, it’s important to stay grounded. Turn off your phone, read scripture, spend time with friends, and remember internet fury is not real life. It’s going to be ok.\" Kirk was not himself always a great role model for staying grounded, thoughtful, or caring to others. He was better known for \"look at me\" stunts like offering completely unsolicited commentary upon Taylor Swift's engagement, calling the singer a \"cat lady\" and telling her to \"engage in reality more,\" to \"reject feminism,\" and to \"submit to your husband\" because \"you're not in charge.\" But his advice itself isn't all bad. Social media so often feeds most hungrily upon our darker emotions; constant reinforcement of anger, fear, frustration, and even jealously (FOMO, anyone?) cannot possibly be good for us to marinate in so often. Maintaining a connection to the physical world and the physical presence of others can be immensely stabilizing—sometimes even helpfully \"boring\"—after we become too addicted to the rush of emotions caused by one more Internet outrage. Kirk was wrong about two things in that tweet, though. First, \"Internet fury\" is quite clearly real life. And two, things may not \"be ok\" even after you set down the phone and are sitting beneath a tent in Utah, talking to students. Authorities announced today that, after several incorrect detentions, they are reasonably certain they have arrested Kirk's shooter. Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, said at a press conference that the shooter's bullets were covered with various bits of graffiti, including: “Notices bulge OwO what’s this?” (online meme involving furries) “Hey fascist! Catch!” “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao” “If you read this you are gay LMAO” There was also a series of markings described as \"up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrow symbols.\" The New York Times described these as a possible \"reference to a sequence of controller moves that unleashes bombs in the popular video game Helldivers 2.\" This is an extremely online style of writing—cryptic, meme-driven, and jokey even about serious or disturbing issues. Was the alleged shooter helped toward his act of violence by the communities he was in online? And are millions of Internet users helping or hurting their own moral and civic identities by watching detailed video of the murder, which was immediately shared on social media? As his press conference wrapped up, Cox made a plea for everyone to follow Kirk's tweeted advice (which he cited). He said that \"we are not wired as human beings—biologically, historically—we have not evolved in a way that we are capable of processing those types of violent imagery... This is not good for us. It is not good to consume.\" And he added that \"social media is a cancer on our society right now. I would encourage people to log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community.\" This could have been useful to Extremely Online People like the alleged shooter, who was turned in by some of his own family members and who might have been dissuaded from his actions had he engaged more directly with them. (Of course, simplistic advice like this is often wrong; difficult family members and broken relationships might mean that in-person connection is also unhelpful for some.) It might also be good advice for the kinds of Extremely Online People who lead the country by posting social media threats to unleash the \"Department of War\" upon Chicago, shown burning in the background. At its heart, though, Cox raises a question about whether social media is 1) a powerful force capable of both great good and terrible incitement and misinformation, or whether it is 2) a mere cancer. I assume Ars readers are divided on this question, given that the Ars staff itself has differing views. One can point, of course, to the successes: The powerless can call out the lies of the powerful, they can gin up \"color revolutions\" to topple dictators, and they can publish their views with an ease and at a cost that not even the printing press—itself an extremely disruptive technology—could manage. On the flip side, of course, is all the \"cancer\": the floods of misinformation and bile, the yelling, the \"cancel culture,\" the virtue signaling, the scams and hoaxes, the ethnic nationalism, the casual sharing of both gore and pornography, the buffoonish natures of the tech overlords who run too many of these services, and that feeling you get when you log in to Facebook and realize with a shock that your aunt is a closet racist. The question for me—a live question, one I'm not sure I can answer—is whether all these negative effects will eventually be regulated or suppressed once we acquire more familiarity with the technology, or whether the fundamentally addictive design of social media apps will pose an insoluble challenge to human willpower and flourishing. Or maybe we put too much blame on \"addictive tech\" when in reality, humans fundamentally pine for spectacle, outrage, cruelty, and a sense of community formed by excluding others. (Social media, in this view, may be more of a diagnostic tool for our condition than a cause of it.) Or perhaps the answer is \"all of the above.\" Can we save the virtues and limit the vices of social media by imposing \"screen time limits,\" avoiding the most toxic communities, and blocking the many online charlatans and fools? Are there lessons we can learn from the general success of the Ars comments, which have been, on the whole, a productive (and highly moderated) enterprise among a specific community? Should we seek to return to smaller and more moderated groups rather than the current global free-for-all of social media? Should we demand that social media apps have more moderation and, if so, do we want to keep this moderation \"neutral\" or let it be more explicitly \"political\"? What will we gain by \"raising the gates\" against certain kinds of posts and posters—and what will we lose? Or is it time, as Cox's metaphor actually suggests, to treat social media as something irredeemable and to reach for the chemotherapy, the radiation, and the surgeon's scalpel?",

    "content": "Here's some good news for a Friday afternoon: For 2025 through August, global electric vehicle sales have grown by 25 percent compared to the same eight months in 2024, according to the analysts at Rho Motion. That amounts to 12.5 million EVs, although the data combines both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs for the total. However, that's for global sales. In fact, EV adoption is moving even faster in Europe, which has grown by 31 percent so far this year (Rho says that BEV sales grew by 31 percent but PHEV sales by just 30 percent)—a total of 2.6 million plug-in vehicles. In some European countries, the increase has been even more impressive: up by 45 percent in Germany, 41 percent in Italy, and by 100 percent in Spain. But despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year. Tesla has seen none of this sales growth in Europe, however—as we noted last month, this region's Tesla sales collapsed by 40 percent in July. China had bought an additional 7.6 million new EVs between January and August of this year, although this growth slowed in July and August, partially as a consequence of robust sales during those months in 2024 thanks to Chinese government policies. And as also noted last month, BYD recently saw a drop in profitability and has downgraded its sales target by 900,000 vehicles (down to 4.6 million) for this year. Meanwhile, here in North America, things aren't quite so hot. EV sales are still growing but barely—up just 6 percent between January and August 2025 compared to the same time period in 2024. August was actually a good month for EV sales in the US as consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the IRS 30D tax credit for clean vehicles, which disappears at the end of September. That's a result of anti-EV policies put in place by President Trump and Republicans in Congress, and it's far from the only one. Other tax credits intended to foster EV adoption by businesses are also being eradicated. The Environmental Protection Agency is no longer fining automakers for failing to meet fleet averages, and the Trump administration has clawed back money earmarked for charging infrastructure. \"Global EV sales have now reached 12.5 million units in the opening eight months of the year,\" said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester. \"The North American market has reached a record monthly high as consumers in the US accelerate purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expires at the end of September. Momentum remains in Europe, underpinned by the emissions legislation, with major automotive countries, Germany and the UK, growing by 45 percent and 31 percent [year to date], respectively. [Year on year] growth in the Chinese market slowed in July–August 2025, however, this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade-in scheme increased last year, which spurred on EV demand in the country,\" Lester said.",

Learn more. Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Protein powder is my secret ingredient. The best protein powders are an easy boost to any of your go-to recipes, from smoothies to muffins to morning waffles. I rely on it to fill in the nutritional gaps when my meals aren’t winning any wellness awards. While the recommended daily allowance for protein is just 0.36 grams per pound of body weight, that’s the minimum to avoid deficiency, not the sweet spot for optimal health. Depending on how active you are or your dietary needs, your daily protein recommendation may increase. For more on this, check out How Much Protein Do I Need? What was once the territory of gym bros trying to bulk up has exploded into the mainstream. Protein powders are on every shelf, in every form and flavor, and for every dietary preference. Whether you’re plant-based, a picky eater, or need a quick nutrient boost, protein powder is your fast pass. But with so many options, fads, and a never-ending list of additives, it’s easy to grab the wrong one. I’ve sifted through the market to find the best of the best protein powder. (As with any dietary supplement, please consult a medical professional or registered dietitian before consuming protein powder.) For more powders, tonics, and elixirs, check out our guides to the Best Greens Powders, Best Electrolyte Powders, and Best Mushroom Gummies. Updated September 2025: I've added Dymatize ISO100, Little Ripples kids protein powder, and Be Well by Kelly, and updated information and specs of all picks. Optimum Nutrition Amazon GNC Optimum Nutrition Optimum Nutrition’s Gold Standard Whey has been a longtime favorite among gym rats. It’s affordable, widely available, and tastes good. It delivers 24 grams of protein per serving, sourced from a blend of whey isolate, concentrate, and peptides. The vanilla ice cream flavor has been my go-to for three years. I use it in smoothies, but I love it even more for baking—I like to swap a couple of scoops for some of the flour in banana bread to give it a protein boost without tasting chalky. Reviewer Louryn Strampe loves the banana cream, which she swears tastes like a yellow Laffy Taffy. While it’s not the “cleanest” protein powder on the market—there are options with fewer additives—it’s reassuring to know the Clean Label Project gave the vanilla ice cream flavor its stamp of approval earlier this year, confirming it tested free of arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury. Dymatize Amazon I'm very picky when it comes to chocolate milk, but I'll easily down a Dymatize Performance Protein Shake, and it even packs five more grams of protein per serving than ISO100. That speaks volumes about Dymatize's flavor game. While fan-favorite Fruity Pebbles leans a little too cereal milk for my taste, there are over 14 sweet flavors to choose from, including Dunkin' collabs and classics like fudge brownie, gourmet vanilla, and strawberry, so you're likely to find one that hits the spot. Unfortunately, there's no unflavored option, and flavor this good obviously comes with some additives: natural and artificial flavors like salt, sucralose, and soy lecithin. It's not the cleanest label out there, but it's easy on the stomach and tastebuds. A solid choice for beginners who care more about taste. Orgain Amazon Orgain’s Organic Protein Powder blends pea, brown rice, chia, and mung bean proteins to hit all nine essential amino acids. It’s USDA-certified organic, kosher, and delivers 21 grams of protein, plus 4 grams of fiber and prebiotics for a little digestive support. With about 15 grams of carbs per serving, it leans higher carb than some plant-based competitors, but that also makes it more filling—ideal if you need something to hold you over between meals. I’ve tested my fair share of vanilla proteins, and Orgain’s vanilla bean flavor is one of the better ones. It’s smooth, not overly sweet, and blends up surprisingly creamy despite being dairy-free. While the formula is free from artificial sweeteners, most flavors include erythritol and gums, which can cause digestive issues for some. Some flavors, like birthday cake, sneak up to 450 milligrams of sodium per serving, which is 20 percent of your daily limit. The iced coffee flavor comes with 60 milligrams of caffeine. Ritual Amazon Ritual Ritual prides itself on transparency, offering a traceable supply chain, so you know exactly what’s going into your protein shake. The Protein Daily Shake 18+ is crafted from organic yellow field peas, grown and harvested exclusively in North America. By sourcing from regenerative farms, Ritual minimizes heavy metal contamination risks and reduces its carbon footprint. The vanilla flavor is handcrafted using vanilla extract sourced from Madagascar. No surprise that it’s certified by the Clean Label Project and won the organization's Purity Award. Ritual’s pea protein is enhanced with L-methionine, rounding out the amino acid profile, with eight grams of essential amino acids and four grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) per serving. It’s a clean option: soy-free, gluten-free, vegan, and free from GMOs, stevia, sugar alcohols, and artificial flavors or colors. While I haven’t tested Ritual’s Pregnancy & Postpartum Daily Shake, it’s worth noting it delivers 250 milligrams of choline per serving to support increased dietary needs during pregnancy and lactation. Promix Amazon Promix When it comes to easy-to-digest protein, Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate stands out. Micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, it's designed for sensitive stomachs. Each serving delivers 30 grams of protein, 6.6 grams of BCAAs, and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids. Promix also nails texture; with less than one percent non-GMO sunflower lecithin, this natural emulsifier helps dissolve the powder in water and milk without any grittiness. I've tossed it into shakes and muffins—the protein shakes weren't my favorite, but the baked goods turned out delicious. The brand also sells protein puff bars (15 grams of protein) in flavors like blueberries & cream, snickerdoodle, and mint chocolate. While I found them too chalky, my fiancé loved them, so they might be worth trying if you're looking for snackable protein. Momentous Amazon Momentous If you're picky about what goes into your protein powder, Momentous checks a lot of boxes. The company sources its whey from European dairy farms, where regulations ensure the cows are grass-fed and free from hormones, steroids, and rBST. The whey is processed using cold microfiltration to preserve its amino acid profile, and it includes ProHydrolase, an enzyme blend meant to boost digestion and absorption. Momentous is NSF Certified for Sport and Informed Sport, making it a top pick for athletes. It's free from fillers, gums, and refined sugar, though it does use natural flavors. With 20 grams of protein per serving, it's great for most people, but bodybuilders and lifters may prefer a powder with a higher protein content. The macros are lean—just three grams of carbs (two from fiber, which helps with satiety) and 1.5 grams of fat, likely from the sunflower lecithin that improves mixability. Taste-wise, it's not the most pleasant on its own. If you like to drink protein straight with water, you might find this one a little rough. I prefer to blend it into a fruit smoothie. Vital Proteins Amazon Vital Proteins Collagen-based powders aren’t the best for muscle growth, but they’ve gained a loyal following for their supposed benefits for hair, skin, and joint health. Vital Proteins’ Vital Performance Protein Powder sets itself apart with an NSF Certified for Sport credential, meaning it’s been third-party tested for safety and label accuracy. This formula combines milk protein isolate with bovine-sourced collagen peptides, making it a gentler option for those with lactose intolerance since it contains minimal to no milk sugar. (It’s still a milk byproduct, so steer clear if you have a dairy allergy.) The powder dissolves well in water or milk alike without clumps. It works well in smoothies and even holds up in baking if you want to sneak some protein into your pancakes. Be Well by Kelly Amazon Walmart Beef protein isolate is made from cow tissue that has been filtered and processed into powder. Whey is just as effective at building muscles and is cheaper, but Be Well by Kelly's protein powder is a good option for those who follow a stricter Paleo diet or are dairy- or whey-free. There are only three ingredients—organic cacao powder, beef protein isolate, and monk fruit sweetener. It packs 24 grams of protein per scoop and is a much finer powder than other protein powders I've tried. It is also a complete protein that has been third-party tested. The main reason I like it, however, is the taste. I do find it difficult to dissolve it plain in water. But with a little peanut butter as an emulsifier, it blends well into a fruit smoothie and makes it taste exactly like a (breakfast) chocolate shake.—Adrienne So Isopure Amazon Isopure This vanilla protein powder is the secret behind my favorite post-workout snack that masquerades as dessert. I mix it with Greek yogurt, whipped cream cheese (not regular!), and some crumbled graham crackers to make a little protein cheesecake dessert. I usually do about half a cup of the yogurt and cheese to anywhere between half a scoop to a full scoop of powder; you should taste-test it yourself to find your perfect ratio. It’s a great go-to after an evening workout, or in my case, a late aerial dance class that leaves my shoulder muscles screaming. The Isopure’s vanilla flavor is impressively strong. It can taste a little too strong without enough ingredients to balance it out. It would make for a fun addition to a smoothie or other mock desserts, like some frozen banana ice cream. It has a really nice vanilla scent to it, too. —Nena Farrell Transparent Labs Amazon Transparent Labs If your priority is clean ingredients and label transparency, Transparent Labs' Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate is for you. This whey is sourced from hormone-free, grass-fed cows, and the formula doesn't include artificial sweeteners, food dyes, or any of that extra junk (minus the natural flavors). It has Informed Choice and Informed Protein certifications, so consumers are getting what they're expecting. There are over a dozen flavors, but I opted for the unflavored version that blends well into smoothies and baked goods without hijacking the taste. Mikuna Mikuna (21 servings) This powder is unusual in that it's not whey-, soy-, or pea-based, but consists entirely of powdered Peruvian lupin bean. A boon for those looking for a clean, single-source source of protein, Mikuna is vegan, paleo, keto, and gluten-free, and even the non-plain flavors (vanilla, cacao) only have five ingredients—along with calcium, fiber, iron, and all nine amino acids. The flavored versions are actually quite tasty, sweetened with cacao powder or vanilla extract, coconut blossom nectar, and monk fruit. Be forewarned, though, that the powder alone can be texturally challenging—online reviews describe it as gritty and chalky, and after drinking it regularly for a few months, I think that’s being generous. (It will keep its suspension longer if mixed with a handheld electric whisk.) Mikuna is, however, an excellent way to bulk up a smoothie, and a potential game changer for those with digestive problems aggravated by dairy, soy, or peas. —Kat Merck Naked Casein: With only one ingredient—micellar casein sourced from hormone-free skim milk—it’s about as clean as it gets. No added sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and no unnecessary additives. It's cold-processed, to avoid any nastiness from chemicals or synthetic fillers, and it’s independently tested for both heavy metals and gluten. Each serving packs 26 grams of protein and 618 milligrams of calcium (about 48 percent of your daily value). But Naked Casein doesn’t contain lecithin, so it won’t dissolve as smoothly as other powders. The best way to mix is with a blender, but I couldn't stomach the taste of this one. Seeq Clear Protein Powder: I was skeptical when I purchased Seeq Clear Protein, but I’m a sucker for anything watermelon-flavored. I was pleasantly surprised. It tastes like a creamier sports drink (I promise it’s better than that description sounds), and each serving has 22 grams of protein and 4.5 grams of BCAAs. There are zero grams of sugar. Like a lot of other clear protein powders, it’s often more expensive than its counterparts. But if lactose irritates your stomach or you want something more like juice and less like a milkshake, it’s worth trying—especially if you mix it with extra water, since it’s on the sweet side. Worth noting is that it takes forever to dissolve, so use a frother or allot extra shaking time. —Louryn Strampe Ghost Whey Protein Powder: Ghost is the protein powder for people who want their post-workout snack to taste like dessert. With flavors like Oreo, Cinnabon, and Chips Ahoy!, it's arguably one of the best-tasting whey proteins on the market. Each scoop delivers 26 grams of protein (50 percent of the daily value) and blends well in shakes, oats, or even DIY protein ice cream. The trade-off here is a longer ingredient list that includes gums, high-fructose corn syrup, and titanium dioxide—a whitening pigment banned as a food additive in Europe. Sakara Protein + Greens Super Powder: With 17 grams of plant-based protein per serving, Sakara's Protein + Greens is just three shy of the 20-gram benchmark we aim for. The blend of pea, hemp, and pumpkin proteins is bolstered by a “super greens” mix of spirulina, wheatgrass, barley grass, and chlorella. Is it dramatically transforming my gut health? Probably not. But on days when my vegetable and protein intake is low, a scoop of this in my smoothie (plus some Greek yogurt for an extra 18 grams of protein) makes me feel a little less like a goblin surviving on iced coffee and string cheese. Wavelength Vanilla Protein Powder: In addition to 20 grams of pea protein per serving, Wavelength's plant-based powder boasts trendy adaptogens and nootropics like maca root, ashwagandha, and Chaga mushroom extract. The brand doesn't disclose how much of each is in the mix, so it's hard to say if they're doing much beyond adding to the price tag. The taste is deeply earthy, which makes it better suited for baking than chugging. Wavelength also makes Little Ripples, a protein powder formulated for kids. Reviews editor Adrienne So made a shake with it for her 8- and 10-year-olds, but it had a strange, chalky texture and a bit of a barnyard funk smell. They refused to drink it. BSN True-Mass Weight Gainer, Muscle Mass Gainer Protein Powder: If you're trying to bulk up or struggle to hit your calorie goals, BSN True Mass is worth considering. This mass gainer packs 1,200 calories per serving, with 50 grams of protein and 215 grams of carbohydrates. Its protein blend includes whey concentrate, casein, milk protein isolate, whey protein isolate, hydrolyzed whey isolate, and micellar casein, so you get a mix of fast and slow-digesting proteins. It also delivers 450 milligrams of calcium and 880 milligrams of potassium, which is a bonus if you want to squeeze in some micronutrients. It tastes great—the strawberry milkshake flavor is spot-on—but these are two scoops at 310 grams, so you'll need to be comfortable with the jumbo serving size. I can't fully endorse the formula because it's packed with artificial sweeteners like sucralose and acesulfame potassium, as well as some iffy additives, including maltodextrin and a gum blend (cellulose, guar, gum Arabic, and xanthan) that might not sit well with everyone. If you have a sensitive stomach, you might want to pass. This one brings protein farts to a new level. Aloha 12oz Chocolate Sea Salt Protein Drink (Pack of 12): Aloha's protein powder is still on my testing docket, but I have tried the brand's ready-to-drink shakes. The chocolate sea salt is surprisingly tasty; it's creamy and rich, but there's a faint aftertaste. I sometimes use the vanilla flavor as a milk base for smoothies, and there's also a coconut flavor I haven't gotten my hands on yet. Each serving packs 20 grams of plant-based protein. Beast Mega 1200 for $199: If you're looking to level up your smoothie game, Mega's 1,200-watt motor cuts through frozen fruit, powders, and fibrous foods with an ease that personal blenders can't match. One button, a timed cycle, and consistent chunk-free results. The three included Tritan vessels are designed with ribbed interiors that boost turbulence for silkier smoothies. Plus, the drinking lid and straw system transforms your blender into a travel cup without the extra dishes. It's available in five colors—cloud white, carbon black, navy, sand, sage, and charcoal—and backed by a two-year warranty. Vitamix Ascent X5 for $750: The Vitamix Ascent X5 is expensive, but if you're in the market for an all-purpose blender, this is the one that makes smoothies feel like an art form. It's got 10 preset programs (smoothie bowls, nut butters, nondairy milks, and more), which means your protein recipes can get as creative as you want. It has a tamper for the thickest of shakes, and the on-screen indicator tells you exactly when to step in. Plus, if your blend needs more mixing, hit the “add 15 seconds” button. The self-cleaning mode is my favorite feature; it's not groundbreaking, but I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a dull chopstick than scrub post-smoothie gunk off a blender. Plus, it's backed by a 10-year warranty, which makes it an investment worth considering. Ninja Blast Portable Blender for $53: Finally, for an affordable option, you might want to consider Ninja's tiny portable blender, which charges via USB-C. The motor isn't super powerful, and the battery isn't long-lived (one charge lasts long enough to thoroughly blend one yogurt smoothie with frozen berries), but this blender is affordable, the vessel and lid are dishwasher-safe, and it's tiny enough to have a permanent home on editor Adrienne So's counter. She has been using this daily for a year to make morning smoothies from Greek yogurt, milk, and frozen berries and bananas with no issues. Is Protein Powder Good for You? It depends. If you’re eating a balanced diet, you’re likely getting all the protein your body needs. Whole foods—nuts, seeds, eggs, low-fat dairy, legumes, and lean meats—offer protein along with fiber, vitamins, and other nutrients that a scoop of powder simply can’t match. Protein powders are not meal replacements. That said, high-quality protein powder may be beneficial if you are recovering from surgery or an injury, have difficulty eating due to illness or aging, or need extra protein for wound healing. It’s also useful if you’re following a strict diet (like veganism) and aren’t getting enough protein through food alone. For athletes, protein powder can be a convenient way to refuel post-workout because the body absorbs liquid protein quickly. Unless you fall into one of these categories, you don’t need a protein powder. Which is the Best Type of Protein Powder? When you're looking at different protein sources, also keep in mind whether you're getting a complete or incomplete protein. All of our picks are complete proteins, meaning that they provide all nine essential amino acids that the body doesn't product itself. Whey protein: Whey protein comes from milk during the cheese-making process, and it’s one of the most efficient ways to get protein into your system. It’s packed with essential amino acids, meaning your body can absorb and use it quickly—great for muscle recovery and growth. There are three whey subtypes, each with its own pros and cons. Casein protein: Casein is the other major protein in milk. When consumed, it forms a gel in your stomach, meaning your body gets a slow, steady release of amino acids. This makes a great option for pre-bedtime protein or keeping hunger at bay between meals. There are two main subtypes: Pea protein: This plant-based protein is made from ground yellow split peas and is high in essential amino acids, including BCAAs. It’s dairy-, gluten-, and soy-free, making it great for people with allergies. Technically, it’s a complete protein, but it’s lower in methionine, so some experts would argue it’s not as complete as whey. Brown rice protein: Brown rice protein is high in fiber, easy to digest, and hypoallergenic, but it lacks some essential amino acids (specifically lysine), making it an incomplete protein. That’s why it’s often blended with pea protein for a more balanced amino acid profile. It’s gentle on the stomach and good for people with food sensitivities. Beef protein isolate: Meat contains protein! Beef protein isolate is made from cow tissue that has been extracted and filtered into powder. What Are the Potential Harms of Protein Powder? While high-protein diets have been studied extensively, the long-term effects of regularly consuming protein in powdered form remain unclear. Not all protein powders are contaminated, but it’s worth checking third-party testing results (like those published by Clean Label Project) before incorporating one into your diet. What Factors Should I Consider When Choosing A Protein Powder? Protein source: Whey, casein, soy, pea, brown rice, egg white—protein powder comes in many forms and caters to different needs (build muscle, weight loss, weight gain, post-workout recovery, etc.). Your choice depends on dietary preferences and your personal goals. Protein content: If your goal is muscle growth, aim for 20 to 30 grams per scoop. Otherwise, match the amount of protein to your dietary or fitness needs. Processing method: Concentrates are the least processed and have more nutrients. Isolates tend to have higher protein content and fewer carbs and fats, while hydrolysates digest the fastest. Allergens and dietary preferences: Make sure your protein powder aligns with your diet. If you're allergic to dairy, soy, gluten, or nuts, double-check labels as many powders sneak in allergens. If you've had digestive issues before, start with a small quantity to test your tolerance before going all in. Additives and fillers: Watch for artificial sweeteners, gums, and thickening agents that can cause bloating and other gastrointestinal issues. Flavors: Powders now come in every flavor from matcha to fruity cereal milk. Choose a flavor you'll actually drink. Brand reputation and certifications: Some brands are rigorous about quality control, third-party testing, and ingredient sourcing, and others aren't. If you want peace of mind, look for certifications like Informed Sport and NSF Certified for Sport, which verify that the product contains what it advertises and is free of banned substances. Cost: Compare cost per serving instead of just the upfront price. How We Test Protein Powders I've been downing protein powders for years, but for this guide, I put each one through a fresh round of testing. Each powder was sampled at least three times to assess taste, texture, and mixability. I mixed them with water, milk, and non-dairy alternatives. I also baked them into muffins and blended into the occasional smoothie because not all of us like our protein straight. I prioritized powders with minimal to no additives and full transparency in sourcing—no unnecessary fillers, gums, or questionable sweeteners. Solubility was a major consideration, too. I also scrutinized manufacturing practices and third-party testing. Certifications (like NSF Certified for Sport or Informed Choice) mattered. Every pick is also a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids. What Are We Testing Next? I’ll be testing Gorilla Formula 23 Coconut Protein 6g BCAAS for $70, Komplex Nutrition Plant-Based Protein for $50, and Puori’s PW1—a pasture-raised whey protein powder—for $69. I'm also testing protein bars for an upcoming guide. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. 6/10 WIRED Editor Amit Katwala has traveled far and wide for a hands-on look at the future of robotic artificial limbs, and the technological progress he witnessed is beyond impressive. But in truth, his quest to become Superhuman is still stuck in the prototype phase. I, on the other hand, have been galavanting around the English countryside wearing the Hypershell Pro X, the first readily available leg-boosting, mile-eating, powered exoskeleton. As a broader product category, exoskeletons have the potential to enhance mobility for those with disabilities, helping them regain independence and improve their quality of life. They can also reduce physical strain in the workplace, minimizing the chances of injury and boosting productivity. But the likes of Hypershell produces nonmedical, wearable exoskeletons that promise muscle-boosting power for us average Joes. The majority of these designs, however, seem to be permanently on preorder, or ambitiously chasing the big bucks on Kickstarter, so it's refreshing to be able to test something that's available on Amazon. Last year I reviewed a prelaunch version of the similar DNSYS X1 (WIRED 5/10) and found it to be glitchy, heavy, and generally disappointing, but it did show promise. It remains stuck in preorder however, as does the much-publicized pair of $5,000 Arc’teryx MO/GO powered pants. So can Hypershell do it better? There are currently three versions of the Hypershell exoskeleton: the basic 400-watt, $900 Hypershell Go X, the $1,199 Pro X which has a 800-watt output, 10.8-mile range, and enhanced capabilities for running and even cycling assistance. And then there’s the Hypershell Carbon X, which uses a titanium alloy instead of carbon fiber and costs $1,500. The Go X offers 7.5 miles per hour maximum speed assistance while the Pro X’s 800-watt motor can help up to speeds of 12.4 miles per hour. Each model collapses down to 16.9 × 10.2 × 4.9 inches, and the Go and Pro X weigh 4.41 pounds, while the Carbon version is 7 ounces lighter. My Hypershell Pro X sample has a 5000-mAh 72-Wh battery, with quoted assisted range of 10.8 miles (17.5 kilometers) and 10 modes, including up and down stairs, down and uphill, cycling, running, race walking, and regular walking. I’ve been wearing the exoskeleton for the past few months while testing various outdoor gear, including hiking boots and rain jackets, and within seconds of turning it on I knew it was significantly more useful than the DNSYS X1, giving my legs a nice power-up on trails. Did I feel like a fool wearing it in public? Absolutely. Did my wife ask me “Why are you walking like Woody from Toy Story?” Yes. But for many people in need, the benefit of the assistance should outweigh the mild embarrassment. Strapping myself in for the first time, I’m impressed by the build quality, the ergonomic fit, and adjustability. The lower back and hip cushioning is particularly good. I’m 5′ 11′′ tall, and most adults—Hypershell estimates 80 percent—will have no fitting issues. The excellent app takes you through the whole process, with step-by-step video instructions on adjusting to fit, and then once you’re corseted in, it demos the various power modes and controls. When you first power on, the inert machine springs to life and tightens up, and once you’ve chosen a power mode, it instantly starts to work as you walk. Hypershell Pro X Series Rating: 6/10 All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more. Using its multiple sensors, the Hypershell detects your leg movement and then makes the most of the motor to help lift your legs as you stride, with up to 32 newton-meters of torque. In Eco mode the effect is noticeable but not aggressive, but in the higher-torque settings, your leg will be propelled upwards. It feels odd and unnatural, like you’re a bionic marionette. Hypershell claims its device offsets 30 kilograms, or 66 pounds of weight. Remember though, it is also having to compensate for its own weight, and while 4.4 pounds isn’t prohibitively heavy, it’s not something you want to add to your pack if the battery dies mid-hike. In all the time testing, and walking, I didn’t once forget I was wearing the Hypershell. The leg straps do get sweaty, and I certainly could feel the unit’s weight. It also makes you walk a little oddly—I guess, robotically. This feels pretty great when locked into a nice pace, but it’s not casual. Without Hypershell. With Hypershell. The Hypershell definitely helps your legs move. It positively jerks them up as you stride, but what impact does it have on physical effort? To test this, I went for two hilly but not mountainous walks with a heart rate tracker on. First I checked my heart rate (83 bpm) and then hiked without the exoskeleton, and then, once my heart rate had returned to its previous level, hiked up again with the Pro X on the Eco mode, which is the standard level recommended. Comparing readings from my Garmin Epix Pro, my unassisted walk—1.8 miles in 28.57 minutes—registered an average speed of 6 km/h and an average heart rate of 102 bpm, with a max heart rate of 127 bpm. In contrast, when I repeated the route wearing the exoskeleton it took 28.19 minutes, with an average speed of 6.1 km/h and an average heart rate of 104 bpm, and maximum of 145 bpm. I was expecting the assisted walk to use less energy and therefore not peak my heart rate. Without Hypershell. With Hypershell. The thing is, I could feel the exoskeleton pulling my legs and propelling me forward. The impact felt considerable, and made the steepest sections feel easier, with less tiredness at the top. Maybe I was walking faster, pushing myself harder with the robot help? Maybe I was nervous, or excited by the new tech, which pushed up my heart rate. Hmmm … But in truth this wasn’t the first time I’d experienced these results. I did a similar test some weeks earlier, up a short, very steep hill with the Hypershell on full power. I was so surprised by the results—which, again, suggested it was taking me more effort with the exoskeleton than without—that I contacted the brand and they sent me a second unit to try, assuming this was a fault. I’ve seen reviews online that also compare heart rate data, and they’ve had more positive results, but I can only go on my own data and repeated experience. The Hypershell feels like it’s helping me, and I like the leg boost, but is it really? Compared to the DNSYS X1, the Hypershell Pro X is an altogether more polished experience, with none of the glitchy issues I experienced before. It’s also the only design currently for sale, so by that reckoning, it is undeniably the best.

Battery performance is pretty good too, only dropping around 35 percent on a three-hour walk on medium power. It drains quicker in the higher modes, however, and as mentioned earlier, I’d hate to have to carry it if the battery dies, so a spare is essential for longer multiday hikes. But it’s not perfect. It’s easier to control the exoskeleton via the app, which involves repeatedly reaching for my phone as I change terrain. The onboard controls are simple—it’s one button—but remembering which setting and how many single-press and double-press actions I’ve done isn’t as intuitive as I’d like. Oh and once you’re strapped in, accessing trouser pockets is difficult. I was impressed by the overall comfort of the design, and while I’d love to be able to wear it under trousers, it’s not that ostentatious. The raised battery and lower back section can interfere with backpacks, though, if they hang quite low. It’s more a niggle than issue, but worth consideration. Another niggle is the fact that you need to plug the whole system in to recharge, despite the battery being easily swappable. You can buy a charging dock for four batteries for $49, and spares for $99, but a simple battery-mounted USB-C port would be so much more convenient. I’m also not convinced by the cycling and running modes. The biomechanics just don’t feel natural. Maybe the AI will learn the difference in my stride or power, but for now it feels unnecessary. And of course, there’s the heart rate tests which remain baffling. I do like the Fitness mode, however, which adds resistance as you walk, making it harder, and increasing my effort. Ironically though, based on my data, it seems that all the modes do this as standard. I still think the Hypershell Pro X can help you walk farther, especially on easier terrain, but as my tests show, it’s not as useful if you’re tackling difficult ascents. Maybe that’s the point. Maybe it’s not a device for already active people. Maybe it can find an audience of older, or less able individuals who are keen to get out and explore more but need a bit of help. From my experience, exoskeletons continue to overpromise and underdeliver. The Hypershell Pro X is the best of a frustrating bunch, but it still feels disconnected from real-world needs. Why would able-bodied people spend big on a gadget to help their perfectly good legs? I have yet to see a single image of an elderly hiker wearing an exoskeleton. It’s madness. These devices have the potential to be like ebikes for the less able, and they would be better pitched as such, rather than expensive toys for the already active.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. 8/10 I'm not afraid to admit that I'm not very good at video games. I'm not bad, but I'm consistently gold tier in basically anything with a ranked mode, from Marvel Rivals to Rocket League. The BlackShark V3 Pro don’t seem to mind. This esports-focused gaming headset has extremely tight spatial audio, bolstered by active noise canceling and the best built-in boom mic my friends have had the pleasure of hearing. I can see why serious competitors would reach for something like the BlackShark V3 Pro. Even if they didn't improve my K/D ratio, and even though they're probably a bit much for an evening of Stardew Valley. They're my pick for gamers looking to spend a bit more on a very premium headset. Excellent spatial audio execution sets the BlackShark apart from its competitors, with THX Spatial Audio supporting more zones than other options, including four overhead. There's a really distinct separation between them, which feels great when I'm trying to track an enemy as they stomp around above me in The Finals. When precision is key, the BlackShark really stand out. On the other hand, if the games you play are less dependent on exact positional audio, it can be a little jarring. I play a lot of World of Warcraft, and I was often startled by other players swooping overhead as I fished; they'll bring any world into sharp detail, but sometimes that isn't exactly what I'm looking for. Excellent sound isolation and active noise canceling give a boost to the clarity of the spatial audio. It works well for that purpose, and might be perfect for tuning out a crowded arena, but I am not the type of person who games in front of crowds.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more. Despite including Bluetooth and ANC, I don't think of this at the type of do-everything headset you might replace noise-canceling headphones with, and not just because the person next to you will wonder if you're secretly talking to the pilots. These are so bulky and obviously for gaming that you probably don't want to wear them outside the house. You'd certainly get some weird looks walking the dog or working from your local coffee shop. In order to fit all those features inside, the BlackShark 3 are noticeably heavier than some of the other headsets I've tested recently. The Pro version with ANC comes in at 367 grams, a full 100-plus grams heavier than the Arctis Nova 3 at 260 grams. If you opt for the non-Pro model without ANC, it's much closer to the SteelSeries at just 270 g, which is very appealing if you mostly game alone at home instead of in front of a crowd of adoring fans. That weight doesn't make them uncomfortable, at least for a few hours at a time, largely thanks to the ear cups, which have a pleasant mesh exterior and squishy interior padding. Razer says there's a layer of pleather underneath to help the noise canceling, but I couldn't tell it was there, which is a good thing, because I hate how hot pleather can get. Still, I miss the ski-goggle band found on most SteelSeries headsets, which distributes weight more evenly across the top of the headband. Especially during long sessions, and on bigger craniums, it can help a lot with comfort. Even the similarly heavy Arctis Nova Pro, my previous upgrade pick, has a softer top-of-head feel. Extra weight also means a bigger battery. I measured close to 50 hours with the active noise canceling on, and right around 60 with the feature turned off. In practice, I only had to plug in the BlackShark V3 Pro once a week or so to keep them topped up. The one time they got low in the middle of a WoW raid night, I was able to charge them up on our 8-minute break from about 4 percent to 11 percent, which was more than enough for the rest of the evening. They got a little confused if I plugged them into the computer just to charge, but an external charger worked just fine while playing. I rotate through a lot of gaming headsets, and most of the time I have to ask for feedback on my microphone quality. Some are better than others, but most are just gaming headset microphones, with a recognizable, slightly tinny vibe. The moment I sat down for my weekly Dungeons and Dragons game, my party members noticed how sharp and clear I sounded. Razer BlackShark V3 Pro Rating: 8/10 All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more. The mic is made even better by the app, which features detailed settings for equalizer and noise reduction, which your friends will appreciate if, like me, you have a noisy dog. There are a ton of settings to dig into here, with both mic enhancement and noise gate presets, as well as a 10-band equalizer for fine-tuning your transmissions. Unfortunately, it has a similar problem to my other favorite gaming headset, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3. In order to provide extra options for balancing outputs and correctly applying equalizer settings, it has to create new system audio outputs. Unlike the Arctis software, which I felt was too invasive, Razer Synapse at least leaves volume and output selection in the system tray, so you don't have to boot it up to switch back to your speakers when you’re done gaming. These aren't for everybody, most of all casuals like me. They're a little bit heavy, would appreciate a little bit of extra work configuring the EQ, and have a little sharper mic than most of your friends will appreciate. At $250 for the Pro version, they’re also one of the more expensive gaming headsets to make the list of my favorite options. If you fancy yourself a professional gamer, these are an exceptional choice, and you can rest easy knowing you've got the same headset on your head as many of the best pros. I don't have any dreams of reaching platinum or diamond, but they sound so good I'll keep using them in the hopes they'll boost my ELO even a few points.

Learn more. Since its debut in 2015, Google’s Fi cellular service has become one of the best affordable phone plans. Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T may be the best-known cellular providers in the US, but in many cases, Fi offers better data plans and a simpler setup and billing system. The catch at the start was that Google Fi only worked on select phones, but these days it'll work on just about anything, even iPhones. (Some features, like network switching, might not be available on every phone.) I originally activated my Google Fi SIM card using a Nokia 5.3, which was never an officially supported device, but it worked just fine. I've also tested the SIM in the Spitz router, a Sony Xperia 1 II, and several other OnePlus and Pixel phones over the years, all without issue. Still, check the compatibility of your device before you sign up. Updated September 2025: We've expanded details in this guide, and updated prices and links. I switched to Google Fi because of the data plans, which are generally better than what you'll get from the big mobile providers. Google likes to say that data is data. In other words, it shouldn't matter whether you're calling, texting, or downloading web pages; it's all just data over the network. I applaud that approach. However, it's important to know that Google is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), and it leases its wireless capacity from T-Mobile, which has a decidedly different view of data. Google Fi no longer offers any “true” unlimited data plans—there are high-speed data caps—but it remains a good value both as a phone service and as a hot spot for nomads and rural internet users like me. If you have an eSIM-compatible phone, you can try Google Fi without committing. Check Google's list to see if your device is supported. If it is, download the Fi app, and it'll walk you through the process of setting up your phone. Fi will give you a new number for the 7-day trial, and your existing number will work as well. This way, you can ensure T-Mobile's coverage works in your area. Note that if you don't cancel Fi, you'll automatically renew on the Unlimited Standard Plan at $50/month when the trial ends. If you decide you do want to make the switch, you can then move your current number over to Fi using the app. The bad news is that if you go this route, you are not eligible for the bring-your-own-phone discounts. Google Fi now offers four plans. All of them include unlimited calls and texts, and none of them require a contract. There are also no signup fees, though you will have to pay taxes and government fees. For each plan, you can add up to five others for a total of six users. If you're not sure how much data you typically use, there's a way to check. On Android phones, go to Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs, and you'll see how much data you've used in the past month. Tap App Data Usage to see which apps use up the most data, and you can also scroll through your data usage from previous months. On iPhones, you can view this by going to Settings > Cellular > and scrolling to the Cellular Data section. If you're regularly using less than 3 GB of data per month, the Flexible Plan might be the best option for you. All of the prices above are for a single line paid monthly. Google periodically offers half off and other specials, usually only if you bring your own phone. Once you've picked your plan and signed up, Google will mail out a SIM card. It took a couple of days for my physical SIM to arrive, but I'll gladly take the slight delay if it saves me from setting foot in a physical carrier store. If you're using an iPhone, Google Pixel, Samsung phone, or other device that supports eSIM, you can set up Fi with an eSIM instantly. Once your chip arrives, you'll need to use a SIM tool to pull out the SIM tray and insert the SIM card into your phone. Then, download the Google Fi app (you'll need to be on Wi-Fi to do this since your chip won't connect to the network yet), and follow the steps there. If you're porting in your old phone number, it may take a little longer. For me, after setting up a new number, Fi was up and running after about 5 minutes. That's it, you're done. I have traveled and lived in rural areas for the past 7 years, and I've tried just about every phone and hotspot plan around—none of them are anywhere near this simple. The only one that comes close is Red Pocket Mobile, which I still use in addition to Google Fi. There are cheaper plans out there, but in terms of ease of use and reliability, Fi is hard to beat. You can use Google Fi as a simple way to add cellular connectivity to any device that accepts a SIM card, like a mobile hotspot. You'll need to activate your Google Fi SIM card with a phone using the Google Fi app, but once the activation is done, you can put that chip in any device your plan allows. If you go with the Unlimited Plus plan, that means you can put your chip in an iPad, Android tablet, or a 4G/5G mobile hotspot. You are still bound by the 50-gigabyte data limit, though, so make sure you don't go too crazy with Netflix. Alternatively, consider ordering a data-only SIM. Google allows you to have up to four if you're on the Unlimited Premium or Flexible plans, meaning you can keep four gadgets—a spare phone or tablet—connected to the internet. The caveat is that they can't place phone calls or receive texts. You don't have to use your phone to activate the SIM first. You can order a data-only SIM in the Plan section of your account, under Devices & subscriptions. If you have an eSIM-only device you want to connect, you can tap Connect your tablet and Fi will offer a QR code you can scan to activate the SIM. There are several features available through the Google Fi app you might not discover at first. One of my favorites is an old Google Voice feature that allows you to forward calls to any phone you like. This is also possible in Google Fi. All you need to do is add a number to Fi's forwarding list, and any time you get a call, it will ring both your cell phone and that secondary number—whether it's a home phone, second cell, or the phone at the Airbnb you're at. This is very handy in places where your signal strength is iffy—just route the call to a landline. Similarly, it can be worth enabling the Wi-Fi calling feature for times when you have access to Wi-Fi but not a cell signal. Another feature that's becoming more and more useful as the number of spam calls I get goes ever upward is call blocking. Android and iOS calling apps can block calls, but that sends the caller directly to voicemail, and you still end up getting the voicemail. Block a call through the Google Fi app, and the callers get a message saying your number has been disconnected or is no longer in service. As far as they know, you've changed numbers. To set this up, open the Fi app and look under Privacy & security > Manage contact settings > Manage blocked numbers, and then you can add any number you like to the list. If you change your mind, just delete the listing. One final thing worth mentioning: I have not canceled my Google Fi service despite switching to Starlink for most of my hotspot needs. Instead, I just suspended my Fi service using the app. That way, should I need it for some reason, I can reactivate it very quickly.",

Learn more. Atlas Coffee Club Amazon Amazon Shroomi The world has been addicted to caffeine for centuries, and in the year 2025 the scientific argument over whether coffee is good or bad for you remains unsettled. One might believe the lack of consensus is a Mainstream Media™ psyop to keep people scrambling for marketable solutions to a problem that’s completely made up, but the cottage industry of coffee alternatives that’s proliferated by this endless tug of war is an interesting outcome regardless of which side you’re on. This is where mushroom coffee makes its inevitable entrance. Some quick googling revealed 10 known players in the game, all of which offer their own riff on a common base formula of dried mushrooms–usually a combo of lion’s mane, chaga, and cordyceps—boosted with buzzy add-ons like probiotics and nootropics. I spent a week with each, including our top pick, Atlas Coffee Club’s Latte Superblend ($26), swapping out my morning coffee for each brand's recommended dose of powder and hot water. After day five I allowed myself to experiment with sweeteners and milks, which you’ll need with almost all of these to get through the entire cup without gagging. Some hit like a mild cup of coffee, some were actual coffee, and others were uncanny concoctions no normal person would ever crave unless they were fully indoctrinated in the heady lifestyle this unique alt-beverage industry revolves around. I laughed, I cried, I got the runs, and I crashed on my couch in the early afternoon more times than I could count, all for science, and all so you don’t have to try this on your own. Also be sure to check out our guides to the Best Coffee Subscriptions, Best Energy Drinks, Best Coffee Makers, and Best Electric Kettles. Updated September 2025: We've added Quince Certified Organic Mushroom Coffee, Shroomi Focus Mushroom, and Spacegoods Rainbow Dust as picks, and updated links and prices throughout. Atlas Coffee Club Atlas Coffee Club As its name denotes, Atlas Coffee Club is a subscription-based mail order coffee service. And a darn good one at that! It's also our top pick in our guide to the Best Coffee Subscriptions. So when it announced it was dipping its toes in the dark arts of adaptogen-infused mushroom coffees, we trusted it could deliver the goods without all the superfluous lore and manosphere cosigns that most others come bundled with. The starter kit includes a frother and a scoop and comes with your choice of Atlas’ riffs on mushroom coffee: a coffee superblend or a latte superblend. The former is a straightforward take on mushroom-infused instant coffee. The fine powder dissolves quickly, the coffee flavor is muted with a roasty aftertaste, and only the last two sips had any amount of silty residue. If this was all Atlas offered, it would do well enough in this space. The latte superblend, on the other hand, is a real treat. Upon my opening the bag, a strong whiff of toasted coconut wafts through the room. The powder emulsifies easily in hot water without any need for a frother. Lacing on the edge of the mug is minimal, and there’s almost no gunky residue or powdery finish to speak of. The flavor of the finished product has a pronounced coconut aroma up front without the requisite sweetness that’s omnipresent in tiki drinks. The swallow offers subtle notes of earthy spice and a soft acidic tang akin to a shot of espresso pulled from Kenyan or Ethiopian beans. It’s an absolute delight to drink. After three mornings of Atlas’ latte superblend standing in for my coffee, I found myself wondering if I could permanently replace my morning brew with this delicious powder. The caffeine buzz was smooth and devoid of any mind-rattling peaks, but the probiotics did a number on my stomach on the two final days of the weeklong experiment with this one. I would not pair this with a rich, fatty breakfast loaded with eggs and dairy unless you work from home by yourself all day. Intermittent rangus aside, Atlas Coffee Club struck gold here. Lucid Amazon Lucid A cursory scan of the About Us section on Lucid’s website reveals it was founded by what appears to be an extreme sports bro, a DJ, and a former marine. The trio’s aesthetic is a trippy minimalist vibe that’s aligned with the bisexual lighting most Twitch streamers use in their backgrounds, and its marketing leans on a preference for nootropics like alpha-GPC and creatine to kick things up a notch so you can rage or do push-ups all night. One tablespoon mixed with 8 ounces of hot water yields a deep-black liquid, with a slight tingle on the front of the sip and notes of toasted sesame on the finish. It’s nothing to write home about on its own, but lack of dusty mouthfeel and off notes make it supremely drinkable. A splash of Chobani Sweet Cream really brought this cup to life, and a mix of steamed oat milk and agave nectar did wonders as well. The upfront effects of Lucid were hard to discern, but the last few days with this pleasant dust were punctuated by an elevated sense of excitement for the rote tasks I carried over from one day's checklist to the next. My girlfriend and I finally cleaned out our attic to make room for some spare boxes of hardwood flooring, and then repetitive schlepping up and down three very tall floors in our 150-plus-year-old house left me invigorated and craving more small domestic victories. I organized the spice drawer after that and felt amazing while doing so. Laird Superfood Amazon Laird Superfood takes its name from cofounder Laird Hamilton, an infamously aggro big-wave surfer who’s best known for being Kevin Costner’s stunt double in the 1995 clunker Waterworld. Hamilton and his wife, sand volleyball superstar Gabrielle Reece, founded Laird Superfood in 2015 with the mission of helping the wellness-curious “take something [they] do every day and make it better.” I don’t drink protein powder every day, but I do drink enough coffee to drift into space quite often and fantasize about what my life would be like if I had the cojones to get towed by jet ski into a 50-foot wave in Tahiti and hope for the best, like Hamilton did in 2000. Laird’s Functional Mushroom Focus coffee is a medium roast that gently tickles the pleasure center of clandestine dark roast freaks, with a hint of smoke on the sip and a gentle numbing tingle on the swallow. It’s a fine coffee on its own, clocking in a few clicks above your average grocery store brand preground medium roast. The added protein creamer is a special treat that’s so naughty it feels good. The suggested one-third cup dose filled almost half my trusty Ember mug when I added before the pour, per the bag's instructions, and it clocks in at a whopping 200 calories with 50 percent of your daily saturated fat intake right there. After five seconds of whisking, the off-white powder dissolved almost fully into the coffee, leaving me with a light brown brew loaded with rich notes of vanilla and coconut. The tandem of coffee-based caffeine and vegan, soy-free protein (plus 9 grams of sugar) was the kick in the pants I needed to bounce back from over a month of placebo-ing my brain into submission with kooky mushroom dust and heady nootropics. I don’t have any surfing plans on the books at present, but as soon as I do I’ll be sure to pack an Aeropress and the full Laird Superfood kit. Shroomi Shroomi Shroomi’s simplistic approach to mushroom coffee is a breath of fresh air in a space that’s quite crowded with brands that wrap fantastical claims in yassified millennial aesthetics. The brand's pre-ground mushroom-infused coffee arrives in colorful, unobtrusive packaging that’s simple to read and irresistible for coffee heads who miss the ’90s. The Mexico Chiapas Light Roast we sampled is a bright and bouncy cup replete with piquant notes of red wine, citrus, and just a wee hint of smoke on the finish. Just three sips of a fresh cup brewed with my trusty Fellow Aiden had me shaking off my post-lunch slump and bounding out the door to run off the pile of leftover pizza I had inhaled less than an hour prior. This is a tasty, approachable, and magical brew you can sneak into any coffee lover's rotation without worrying about offending them with bizarre off notes from the mushroom enhancements. Cuppa Amazon Like the friendly foreigner who calls his daily cup of tea or coffee his “cuppa,” this newcomer is polite, congenial, and inoffensive. The first sip brought to mind a really good cup of coffee at a nameless diner, with a light body and very mellow acidic notes on the swallow. The small dose of ruddy powder pulled from the bag with the included plastic scoop dissolved thoroughly with a few stirs, and the pristine lack of sediment in the cup was exactly as advertised. The boost of energy is also unassuming and easy to relegate to the background, which could be a welcome respite from the blast of caffeine many coffee addicts think they need right when they wake up every morning. After a week with Cuppa I started to enjoy easing into my daily brain vibrations rather than white-knuckling it off the rip at 7 am on the dot every morning. Micro Ingredients Amazon (28 oz.) The fine brown powder that’s packed tightly into this massive bag has a faint smell of burnt coffee, sort of like that last bit of sludge that’s stuck to the bottom of a Bunn carafe after a long day at a diner. The taste is forgettable and inoffensive. A hat tip to Micro Ingredients is in order for its flawless execution of a product that’s as mid as mid can possibly get: It barely tastes like coffee or mushrooms, yet it gestures toward both and offers the same end result for the user. I started with 2 teaspoons of the powder mixed into 8 ounces of hot water with the handheld blender the folks at MUD/WTR so graciously included in its own overengineered box (see below), and it took just a few seconds to realize this level of emulsion is overkill. You won’t need more than a few turns of a common spoon to completely dissolve Micro Ingredients in your cup, and the lack of silty or gunky residue is greatly appreciated after a few sips. I gussied up subsequent cups with 4 ounces of steamed milk and 1 teaspoon of simple syrup for a slightly more gratifying sip, but it tastes fine on its own and would be a decent substitute for coffee on a camping trip or in some sort of emergency. The caffeine content is just a few clicks above a cup of decaf, which makes this a nice late-afternoon pick-me-up for folks who have to take it easy with the real stuff. Rasa Amazon The aesthetic of Rasa’s packaging, which lands between the decor of a Midwestern strip mall Mediterranean café and a box of Moroccan tea from Trader Joe’s, kinda says it all with this uber-mellow mushroom beverage. Very few discernible flavors hit on the sip, but the finish has slight notes of dates and the mildest suggestion of citrus. The lack of caffeine makes Rasa somewhat of an oddity on this list, but the market for decaf drinks is substantial, and I’m sure plenty of folks who mainline herbal tea all day would relish the opportunity to try something a bit fancier and more exotic than their usual lineup of grass and flowers and essential oils and whatever else they refer to as “tea” these days. I started adding steamed oat milk and a couple drops of mint simple syrup to gussy this up toward the end of my week with this one, and I’m all aboard the Rasa train when a chill evening on the couch is what the doctor ordered. Max Fit Amazon The flavor of Ten Mushrooms is remarkably similar to that of Ryze (see below): smoky and savory with a sour finish and a dusty residue. A week with this did little to convince me that mushroom brew is the coffee of the future, but it didn’t offend my sensibilities or my bowels in any notable way. If I were forced to choose between Ten Mushrooms and Ryze, I would choose the former due to its bullshit-free spin on a cottage industry that’s filled with late-stage capitalist trapdoors and other forms of subscription-based chicanery. As I write this, a 142-gram bag of Ten Mushrooms is about $10 cheaper than Ryze, and you can buy it instantly on Amazon without navigating several pages of subscriptions, pop-up discount offers, and other digital shakedowns. When the economy crashes and you still need to focus your chakras and conquer your ADHD with mushroom coffee, Jeff Bezos and Ten Mushrooms will be waiting for you with open arms. Melting Forest Amazon When browsing the various mushroom coffees available on the web, I was surprised to find that Melting Forest is the only prominent brand that really leans into the schwilly, post-Jerry ’90s aesthetic associated with a different strain of shrooms. The packaging is a toned-down riff on something one would find in a mall kiosk that sold blacklight posters and grinders until Spencer’s Gifts rolled through and put them out of business. It’s likely the same ex-hippie who does all the design work for Philz Coffee who slapped together Melting Forest’s website. The flavor of this powdered, lightly caffeinated coffee replacement tastes exactly like what you’d imagine to be the ideal brew of a guy who flips out when the barista attempts to rinse out the handmade ceramic blob he brings into his dusty old cafe in Marin at the exact same ungodly hour every morning. The upfront taste has a light bitterness that would repel coffee noobs but endear old heads whose tastes have evolved from Folgers to Stumptown and back again. There’s very little grit in the top 80 percent of the cup, but the small bits of silt that linger at the bottom bring the funky, earthy flavor of the mushroom blend to life. Melting Forest plays nice with sweeter alternative milks like Pacific Foods coconut milk or original Silk soy milk. The energy level is a mild tickle of alertness that’s on par with a can of yerba mate or a half-caff Americano. It’s a reliable daily drinker that pairs well with long days of organizing stacks of magazines, working on a VW bus, and haranguing your local NPR affiliate about the lack of jazz fusion in its playlist. Om Om (2.2 ounces) The bulk of Om’s catalog is billed as “dietary supplements,” so its Master Blend is not exactly the kind of thing you’ll want to drink on its own. I tried this for science, of course, and it wasn’t terrible! There’s a vegetal flavor on the sip that tastes like potato water, and the finish has an astringent tingle that’s akin to the tiniest dose of Sichuan peppercorns steeped in hot water. Om really shines when it’s added to a cup of coffee brewed with beans from the Global South. One teaspoon of this sand-colored dust added a savory pop that smoothed out the brightness of my favorite Colombian Supremo beans from Costco, and the requisite jitters that usually kicked in after three cups of the brew felt mellower than usual with Om mixed in. The silty residue at the bottom of the cup is best avoided, but it won’t harsh your vibe too much on the whole. Ryze Amazon Ryze One could consider two different approaches to how purveyors of mushroom coffee dial in the flavor profile of their product: They can go all in with a bombastic brew filled with spices and overtones, or they can play it safe and concoct the base of a beverage that tastes more like memories of other drinks than a beverage with an identity of its own. The underwhelming flavor of Ryze falls in the latter camp. In fairness, there are plenty of folks who have no interest in savoring their morning beverage and instead need to put the liquid inside them as fast as possible so they can “adult” that day. Twenty-one-year-old Pete thought people who claimed to enjoy espresso were insane, yet here I am, two decades later wishing I could sip bitter bean water instead of this sour cup of forgettable swill that curdled the whole milk I tried to cut it with. A week with Ryze did little to boost my mood, focus, or energy. It mostly made me cranky and sad. Everyday Dose Amazon Of all the contenders included in this experiment, Everyday Dose feels the most like a wellness influencer pyramid scheme. One month of this fantastical dust promises better sleep and boosted mood. Two months promises a healthy gut, and three months promises glowing skin and boosted immunity. It’s easy to acquire three months of Everyday Dose because its subscription-only model is damn near impossible to cancel. It’s difficult to drink this daily for even a week, though, but best of luck if a guy with an alpha jawline and yacht full o’ thots in Croatia told you otherwise! Unlike MUD/WTR (below), which seems to be the closest analog as far as aesthetics and cheekiness go, Everyday Dose boasts a wee bit of caffeine, which is appealing for coffee addicts like yours truly. I first mixed 1 tablespoon of the powder with 8 ounces of hot water and drank it straight up, which yielded an unappetizing liquid that tasted like a mix of Chex Mix and bong water. Some frothed oat milk and a squirt of simple syrup turned out to be the most drinkable form, but I’d be lying if I said I enjoyed any of it. By the end of the week I found myself burning off the slight hit of energy and focus this provided with a 30-minute cardio sesh in my basement followed by five to 10 minutes on the toilet, right on queue every time. People pay money for that type of “regularity,” so I guess that’s something! Spacegoods Spacegoods For generations, caffeine addicts have flocked to diners with names like Jim’s Coffee Pot, where they can wash down bacon and eggs with murky coffee that’s been stewing in a Bunn coffee maker for who knows how long. This style of brew is an acquired taste, for sure, but there’s no beating it when you’re hungover and half awake. The savory finish of Spacegoods’ “coffee-flavored” Rainbow Dust hits like that first sip of coffee at your estranged uncle’s favorite greasy spoon, with a roasty, almost burnt flavor that slowly fades into a subtle umami hit that tricks your brain into thinking some hash browns might be burning on a flat top in the next room over. Clocking in at 120 mg of caffeine per 12-ounce cup, this is a nice happy medium between an energy drink and a cup of tea, making it crushable for those of us who drink cup after cup as a matter of habit rather than the means to an end. Quince Quince Quince functions as a modern millennial’s answer to J.Crew, with a wide variety of urbane, unflashy fashions for sale in its utilitarian web store. Offering its own mushroom coffee–which is currently available via a wait list—is a logical gambit for a web-based “everything store” that seems marketed squarely at the type of childless creative directors who’ve been bullied by the Wellness Industrial Complex into thinking drip coffee is the brutish pastime of crude populists. Quince has done quite well in concocting a charming, understated magic powder that gathers all of the sensory pleasures of a brisk fall afternoon and swirls them around in a smooth and mildly savory cup. Notes of cardamom and cinnamon tickle the nostrils as the powder easily dissolves into hot water or milk, and a faint hit of light roast coffee and umami punctuates the top of the sip. The sip concludes with a gentle tingle of acidity and a barely noticeable shock of numbing spice that’s too subtle to give even the meekest decaf tea enthusiast pause. The low caffeine content makes Quince’s brew a poor choice for turbo-charged mornings that demand a stronger hit of energy, but it’s a great afternoon or early-evening brew that’s well-suited to offer a gentle kick in the cropped stovepipe trousers without pummeling your psyche into white-knuckled submission. As a hopeless caffeine junkie, I plan to keep this in the cupboard well into the winter for a nice post-dinner cuppa to keep cozy while I watch my programs with my pets in my quiet, child-free home. Quince Certified Organic Mushroom Coffee is currently out of stock, but you can join the wait list at the link. Four Sigmatic Organic Coffee for $17: Four Sigmatic was founded about a decade ago by Finnish-American bohos who had the prescience to market mushroom coffee to woo-woo Angelenos who are rich enough to disregard science. Its catalog is expansive and includes a whole constellation of mushroom-infused ingestibles, with bagged, preground coffee serving as the flagship product alongside instant latte mixes, smoothie add-ins, and “capsules.” Buying from Four Sigmatic is a breeze—no need for subscriptions, kits, or any other nonsense. Just pick out what you want, pay for it, and it shows up on your doorstep a few days later. Four Sigmatic’s Focus blend is labeled as a dark roast, but it’s missing the cigarette-butts-and-bowling-alley aftertaste that looms on the finish of similar blends. Despite my preference for lighter beans, this hit like a hug from an old friend after weeks of sipping murky silt. The caffeine buzz normalized after two days of using Think in lieu of more standard shroom-based coffee replacements, so I added a three-quarter-teaspoon hit of the powdered Focus blend to my daily cup to see what would happen. Within 10 minutes I felt an overwhelming urge to sort my finances spreadsheet in preparation for tax season, then I set up a new template in Loopy Pro to accommodate a friend who planned to join my basement jam session that evening. He bailed, but I was jacked on Genius Adaptogens so I played all the instruments myself into the wee hours of the night. MUD/WTR Original Blend for $60: The packaging of MUD/WTR isn’t quite as unhinged as a bottle of Dr. Bronner's, but it’s definitely in the same realm. The spicy dust inside the can is a maximalist circus of weirdness as well, with herbaceous stalwarts like turmeric and masala chai holding it down alongside the usual shroom suspects. It took me a few days to realize that properly emulsifying this ruddy power per the suggested instructions—1 tablespoon with ¾ cup of water, battered thoroughly with the included handheld immersion blender—is an impossible task, so I started experimenting with supplemental ingredients in hopes that some blend of milk, fat, and sugar would minimize the gritty aftertaste that overwhelms the palate. I landed on 1 tablespoon of simple syrup and 4 ounces of whole milk frothed in my trusty Subminimal NanoFoamer Pro. The final result hits somewhere between a chai latte and the kind of hot cocoa you’d order at a coffee shop with boring ’90s music, mean baristas, and a dirty bin full of stale vegan + gluten-free snacks next to the register. I didn’t hate it, but the bottom quarter of the cup is an undrinkable gunky mess. And don’t get me started on the chunky brown lacing that clings to the edge of the cup. The physical and mental effects of MUD/WTR felt more like a facsimile of a boost than a visceral kick in the pants, but a placebo high is better than nothing, right? Combine that with the amount of adjunct ingredients required to make this drinkable and I ended up with a beverage I would only drink every now and then as a treat on a chilly day rather than a daily sipper I can rely on for increased focus, energy, virility, and the million other things this product promises within the wall of text that adorns its packaging.

    "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. Imagine that someone gives you a list of five numbers: 1, 6, 21, 107 and—wait for it—47,176,870. Can you guess what comes next? If you’re stumped, you’re not alone. These are the first five busy beaver numbers. They form a sequence that’s intimately tied to one of the most notoriously difficult questions in theoretical computer science. Determining the values of busy beaver numbers is a daunting challenge that has attracted a cult following among both professional and amateur mathematicians for over 60 years. Researchers identified the first four busy beaver numbers in the 1960s and 1970s. The conspicuously larger fifth number, called BB(5), was only definitively pinned down last year, by a team made up mostly of amateur mathematicians working together in an online community called the Busy Beaver Challenge. No one knows how big BB(6) is. All we have are lower limits—truly staggering ones. In 2022 busy beaver hunters established that BB(6) must be, at a minimum, so large that it’s literally impossible to write down in ordinary decimal notation. Even if you somehow carved a digit into every atom in the cosmos, you’d run out of atoms before making any measurable progress. “It’s way beyond anything that we could ever grasp or get our hands on,” said Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin. Busy beaver hunters have now discovered that this stupefyingly big number must be even bigger. The finding comes from one of the most mysterious and prolific contributors to the Busy Beaver Challenge, who proved a new lower limit on BB(6) in June and broke the record again a mere nine days later. The new results make the 2022 lower bound look positively puny. “I keep on being surprised,” said William Gasarch, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland. “Six is getting us into the stratosphere of large numbers.” The notoriously difficult question behind the busy beaver numbers is this: Given the code of a computer program, can you tell whether it will eventually stop or run forever? In 1936, the pioneering logician Alan Turing proved that there’s no universal procedure for answering this question, which became known as the halting problem. Any method that works for some programs will fail for others, and in some cases, no method will work. Turing proved this seminal result by inventing a formal mathematical model of computation in which programs are represented by hypothetical devices now called Turing machines. Each Turing machine performs computations in discrete steps according to a unique list of simple rules. The more rules a Turing machine has, the more complex its behavior can get, and the harder it can be to determine whether it will halt. But just how much harder? In 1962, the mathematician Tibor Radó invented a new way to explore this question through what he called the busy beaver game. To play, start by choosing a specific number of rules—call that number n. Your goal is to find the n-rule Turing machine that runs the longest before eventually halting. This machine is called the busy beaver, and the corresponding busy beaver number, BB(n), is the number of steps that it takes. In principle, if you want to find the busy beaver for any given n, you just need to do a few things. First, list out all the possible n-rule Turing machines. Next, use a computer program to simulate running each machine. Look for telltale signs that machines will never halt—for example, many machines will fall into infinite repeating loops. Discard all these non-halting machines. Finally, record how many steps every other machine took before halting. The one with the longest runtime is your busy beaver. In practice, this gets tricky. For starters, the number of possible machines grows rapidly with each new rule. Analyzing them all individually would be hopeless, so you’ll need to write a custom computer program to classify and discard machines. Some machines are easy to classify: They either halt quickly or fall into easily identifiable infinite loops. But others run for a long time without displaying any obvious pattern. For these machines, the halting problem deserves its fearsome reputation. The more rules you add, the more computing power you need. But brute force isn’t enough. Some machines run for so long before halting that simulating them step by step is impossible. You need clever mathematical tricks to measure their runtimes. “Technology improvements definitely help,” said Shawn Ligocki, a software engineer and longtime busy beaver hunter. “But they only help so far.” Busy beaver hunters started chipping away at the BB(6) problem in earnest in the 1990s and 2000s, during an impasse in the BB(5) hunt. Among them were Shawn Ligocki and his father, Terry, an applied mathematician who ran their search program in the off hours on powerful computers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 2007, they found a six-rule Turing machine that broke the record for the longest runtime: The number of steps it took before halting had nearly 3,000 digits. That’s a colossal number by any ordinary measure. But it’s not too big to write down. In 12-point font, those 3,000 digits will just about cover a single sheet of paper. In 2022, Shawn Ligocki discovered a six-rule Turing machine whose runtime has more digits than the number of atoms in the universe. Three years later, a Slovakian undergraduate computer science student named Pavel Kropitz decided to tackle the BB(6) hunt as a senior thesis project. He wrote his own search program and set it up to run in the background on a network of 30 computers in a university lab. After a month he found a machine that ran far longer than the one discovered by the Ligockis—a new “champion,” in the lingo of busy beaver hunters. “I was lucky, because people in the lab were already complaining about my CPU usage and I had to scale back a bit,” Kropitz wrote in a direct message exchange on the Busy Beaver Challenge Discord server. After another month of searching, he broke his own record with a machine whose runtime had over 30,000 digits—enough to fill about 10 pages. Kropitz’s machine held the BB(6) record for 12 years. Then, in May 2022, Shawn Ligocki started a new job where he had access to a powerful computer cluster, and he decided to try running his old code on newer hardware. Sure enough, he found a new champion that beat Kropitz’s record. The discovery kicked off a flurry of activity. Twice in the span of two weeks, Ligocki announced a new champion on a busy beaver mailing list. Each time, Kropitz beat his record within three days. Ligocki remembers his father marveling at how Kropitz pulled it off. “He was joking that he imagines Pavel has already solved BB(6),” Ligocki said. “Whenever we find a champion, he just goes and pulls out of his bag one that’s a little bit bigger.” But the last two machines that Ligocki and Kropitz discovered didn’t run just a bit longer than the reigning champion—their runtimes were on an entirely new level. To understand numbers this large, we need to go back to the familiar mathematics of addition and multiplication. Start by adding up n copies of a number—that’s just the definition of multiplication by n. If you instead multiply n copies of a number, that’s known as exponentiation. So what happens if you repeatedly exponentiate a number? That process defines a new operation called tetration, denoted by two arrows pointing up. Tetration gets big fast. 10↑↑1 is just 10. But 10↑↑2 is 1010, or 10 billion, and 10↑↑3 is 10 raised to the 10-billionth power: a 1 followed by 10 billion zeros. To write out all the digits you’d need a stack of paper a thousand feet high. At 10↑↑4, you cross a symbolic threshold where it’s no longer a matter of finding enough paper—there are far more digits than atoms in the universe. When Ligocki beat Kropitz’s record for the second time, it was with a six-rule Turing machine that ran for over 10↑↑5 steps before halting. Kropitz countered with a machine that ran for 10↑↑15 steps—that’s a tower of tens 15 stories high. They’d left the familiar world of digits far behind. “That was the end of an era,” Kropitz wrote over direct message. It was also the end of an era in another respect. Until then, the busy beaver game had been a competition, and researchers mostly worked alone. Then the Busy Beaver Challenge was formed, ushering in a new age of collaboration. The Busy Beaver Challenge was founded in 2022 by a computer science graduate student named Tristan Stérin with the express purpose of rigorously proving the true value of BB(5). In summer 2024 the group succeeded, with a key contribution from a mysterious newcomer known only by the pseudonym mxdys. News of the result appeared in Quanta, where Katelyn Doucette, an undergraduate computer science student at Virginia Tech, happened to see it. She soon joined the Busy Beaver Challenge community, at first just dropping in to the Discord server from time to time. But in May she made an exciting discovery, and since then she’s become one of the most active contributors to the BB(6) hunt. “I’ve just been kind of hooked,” she said. “It’s such a beautiful set of problems.” In the year since putting the finishing touches on the BB(5) proof, mxdys had steadily chipped away at the BB(6) problem, using sophisticated automated methods to classify all but a few thousand “holdout” machines. Doucette was rooting around in the list of holdouts when she found one that looked especially promising. Analyzing it further with some help from Shawn Ligocki, she discovered that its runtime was second only to that of Kropitz’s reigning champion. What’s more, Doucette’s machine belonged to a class of machines known as shift overflow counters, which achieve long runtimes using a very different mechanism than Kropitz’s champion. “It’s exciting to see that these busy beavers have found a new technology,” Ligocki said. A few other busy beaver hunters had previously discovered shift overflow counters that halted after a long time, but Doucette’s discovery made the team suspect that these machines were more plentiful than they’d realized. And if some of the first ones to be studied had come within striking distance of Kropitz’s record, others would likely surpass it. Busy Beaver Challenge contributors rushed to analyze other shift overflow counters, but mxdys got there first. On June 16, they announced the discovery of a new champion that halted after 10↑↑107 steps—that is, its runtime is a tower of tens that’s 10 million stories high. Writing this number down as a string of digits is out of the question. But even writing it as a tower of powers gets dicey: In 12-point font, that line of tens would stretch out for about 25 miles. Kropitz, who saw the news while away on vacation, accepted the loss of his title graciously, writing in the Discord server, “unfortunately, i won’t be performing my 3-day trick this time.” It helped that he had a consolation prize. A month earlier, he’d nabbed the record for the longest-running known seven-rule Turing machine. At least for now, Kropitz is still on the leaderboard. The new record didn’t last long. A week later, mxdys broke it again with a machine whose runtime is—yet again—on a qualitatively new level. To write it down in its most succinct form, we need to introduce an absurd mathematical operation called pentation, represented by three arrows pointing up. Pentation is repeated tetration—in other words, it bears the same relationship to tetration as tetration does to exponentiation. The total number of steps that mxdys’ new champion took before halting was greater than 2↑↑↑5, or 2↑↑(2↑↑(2↑↑(2↑↑2))). To unpack this expression, you work outward from the innermost parentheses: 2↑↑2 is 4, and 2↑↑4 is a bit over 65,000. That leaves you with 2↑↑(2↑↑65,000), making the height of the final stack of 2s an incomprehensibly large number. Forget about writing a tower of powers that stretches out for miles or megaparsecs. Even this more compact notation no longer fits in the universe. This new result is still just a lower limit on BB(6)—the true value could be even higher. Busy beaver hunters don’t expect to have a definitive answer anytime soon. The first sign of trouble was a monstrous six-rule Turing machine that the team has named Antihydra, discovered by mxdys last year. Antihydra almost certainly never halts. But researchers haven’t been able to prove it. And there’s a good reason for that: A busy beaver hunter who goes by Racheline has shown that the question of whether Antihydra halts is closely related to a famous unsolved problem in mathematics called the Collatz conjecture. Since then, the team has discovered many other six-rule machines with similar characteristics. Slaying the Antihydra and its brethren will require conceptual breakthroughs in pure mathematics. But to avid busy beaver hunters, that’s no reason to be discouraged. There are still thousands of six-rule Turing machines to explore, each with its own rich behavior. “For me, the most valid reason to do math is because it’s fun. It is art,” Racheline wrote in a Discord direct message. “There will always be something new to do.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

Learn more. Indoor plant care is always tricky. While it's all fine and dandy to take care of them when the summer sun is shining, keeping your plants alive in winter can feel like a whole ’nother story. Being a houseplant enthusiast is akin to having several silent children, all with finicky needs and limited ways of communicating them. If your green thumb is feeling a little yellow or brown these days, fear not! I interviewed several experts to figure out exactly how to keep your plants happy during the colder months. Here’s what they had to say. The fact of the matter is, most plants don't look “happy” during winter. Because it's winter. Unless you have a fancy automated hydroponic garden at your disposal, your greatest tools will be patience and attentiveness. Most plants have new growth during the longer days of spring and summer and enter a period of slowness or dormancy during shorter days of autumn and winter. Brian Wheat, professor of horticulture at Trident Technical College, says, “Stop trying so hard and worrying so much” and reminds us that time and patience are crucial (and that maybe we shouldn't anthropomorphize plants). “Perhaps we forget the fact that what may look like a struggling plant today could be thriving in, let's say, three to four weeks, if we give it a chance.” He adds, “Nine times out of 10, your plants are OK and don't really need much from you. In fact, you might be doing them more bad than good by being a hummingbird plant parent (I just made that up, it's kind of like helicopter parenting, but for plants).” Tatiana Anderson, cofounder of Top Tropicals, says not to panic if growth slows or a few leaves drop. “What you want to see is steady color, firm leaves, and no major changes,\" she says. \"A ‘happy’ winter plant often looks calm, not busy.” Watering is the bane of my existence, as evinced by the monstera that I accidentally drown every other month. “One of the biggest issues with house plants is overwatering, which can lead to problems like root rot,\" says Wheat. \"This is especially challenging during the winter months,” And it can be even trickier if your plants are outside during the warmer months. Moving them indoors means moving them to an environment that's drier and cooler. “Relative humidity is usually between 30 and 50 percent inside, whereas plants generally prefer a higher humidity,” Wheat says. He points out that the soil or media will dry out faster, especially in heated homes. But that doesn't mean you need to water plants more in winter. Because they aren't growing as actively, they're doing less “plant stuff” such as transpiration and photosynthesis. That means they're using less water. Justin Hancock, Costa Farms horticulturist, says to be wary if you usually water your plants on a schedule. “If you’re used to giving them a fixed amount of water every week, you could inadvertently overwater in winter if they don’t drink that much. If you’re in doubt, it’s almost always better to let houseplants get a little too dry than to keep them consistently too wet.” And, according to Andrew Connolly, founder of Little Flower Cottage, you should “try to always use room temperature water, as really cold water can shock the plant.” He adds that “overwatering is the fastest way to lose a plant in the winter.” Anup Mutalik, chief editor at Houseplants Nook, says, “We always do the finger test and water only when the top 2 inches are dry. Overwatering is a bigger risk in winter, because evaporation slows down. For most plants, we cut back to watering once every 15 days!” Wheat advises to make sure your plants aren't bone-dry or soaking wet. “Get to know the weight of your pot when it is dry and watered,” he says. “Feel it out.\" Anderson adds that if the soil on top is dry and the pot feels light, it's time for water. Per Wheat: “If your plant is wilting and the soil is dry, it needs water. If your plant is wilting and the soil is wet, it's overwatered.” He also reminds us to be patient. “A simple change you make can take days or weeks to show an impact.” Briignite Amazon (2-Pack) Move your plants close to windows so they can get enough light. “Most plants prefer direct to indirect sunlight. An east-, or southeast- to southwest-facing window can provide this. North-facing windows do not. If you don’t have any windows providing sunlight, artificial light will no doubt be a requirement,” says Wheat. Hancock adds, “Put a thermometer at the windowsill and check it periodically (particularly at night) first. Make sure the windowsill doesn’t drop below about 55 [degrees Fahrenheit] or so; cooler temperatures than that can stress some species.” Connelly recommends rotating plants every week or so, too. “Basically all sides need to get roughly the same amount of light.” Every expert I spoke with recommended snagging a few inexpensive full-spectrum grow lights to supplement your plants during the winter. (I'm working on a buying guide on the Best Grow Lights, so look for WIRED-tested recommendations soon! WIRED editor Kat Merck likes the full-spectrum bulbs above, which she puts in can lights for extra-tall plants in dark corners.) Mutalik says, “You can just buy a couple grow lamps and keep rotating plants in and out of them so you don't invest too much at once.” Goha Goha Experts also recommend ensuring that your plants' leaves are free of dust, which blocks the light. Hancock points out that dust can accumulate faster in the winter due to drier air and the use of furnaces or other heat sources like fireplaces. “Any dust film that builds up reduces the amount of light that actually reaches the leaf. So a really dusty plant in a sunny window might only be able to access half the light coming through if a dust layer is blocking the other half,” he says. You can gently wipe them with a soft, damp cloth or use a specialty tool designed for the purpose, like Goha's microfiber Leaf Sweep, above. Dreo Amazon Dreo Hancock says that, similarly to how humans can experience dry skin and chapped lips in the winter, plants can feel the effects of low humidity and dry air, too—especially plants with thinner leaves. “As a general rule, the thicker the leaf texture, the more resilient a plant is to low humidity,” he says. He recommends boosting humidity by “investing in a small humidifier or grouping plants together, [since] they release moisture in the air as they breathe.” He also says that most plants are comfortable with the same humidity you are—about 40 to 60 percent. And you can skip the misting. “Misting adds humidity for only a couple of minutes. It’s not enough to actually help the plant, unfortunately,” says Hancock. “If leaf edges turn brown or curl, that’s usually a humidity cry for help,” per Mutalik. “We keep humidity-loving plants like calatheas, ferns, and marantas grouped together on pebble trays and run a humidifier nearby.” (Our WIRED-tested favorite is above.) He says that a windowed bathroom is also great for tropical plants that love high humidity. “It doesn't have to be fancy,” adds Anderson. We already covered that you should monitor the warmth near your windows to ensure it doesn't drop below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. But ambient air temperatures can affect your houseplants as well. “If you’re feeling chilly, your plants probably are, too,” says Hancock. “And they can’t put on a sweater.” You'll also want to watch out for drafts. “If you have a houseplant near a heating vent where it’s getting exposed to air that’s noticeably warmer or cooler than the ambient air temperature, it can stress your plant, causing leaves to yellow prematurely,” says Hancock. Drafts can be caused by exterior doors and windows. Connolly points out that heating vents and space heaters can be detrimental, too. Plants “like the temperature to stay consistent and not be swinging back and forth between hot and cold.” Awareness is key when it comes to heat and airflow. “We keep anything leafy or tropical at least 2 feet away from heaters and ensure windows are well-insulated,” says Mutalik. Garden Safe Amazon If you're bringing your plants indoors from outside, experts recommend quarantining them for a period of time to ensure they aren't hosting any pests that could affect your other houseplants. (Because let's be real—nobody has just one houseplant.) “Catching them early saves a lot of heartache,” says Anderson. Mutalik and the rest of the Houseplant Nook quarantine their plants for two weeks. Check under every leaf for mites, mealybugs, or gnats. If you encounter pests, there are a few ways of addressing them that can vary based on preference and plant species. Wheat removes them manually if possible, and wipes them down with a cloth or a light vinegar solution before moving on to other, more aggressive measures like horticultural oils or soaps if needed. (Editor Kat Merck uses the insecticidal soap above on her houseplants and hydroponic gardens.) Connolly wipes plants down with a cloth and then rinses them in the sink. And Mutalik says that Neem oil or castile soap can work wonders if you catch the pests early; wipe the leaves, especially broader leaves, every two weeks to prevent infection. While many winter pests hitch a ride indoors, Hancock points out that dry, warm conditions (like those found in heated homes in winter) are the ideal environment for spider mites. “Regularly washing plant leaves can help dislodge spider mites and help keep the population low. If you’re just seeing spider mites and don’t want to spray, consider investing in beneficial mites. Beneficial mites will eat the spider mites and don’t harm your plant,” he says. Schultz Walmart (8 oz.) Ace Hardware (4 oz.) Fertilizer is always a little confusing, and it can be even more puzzling in the wintertime. “I would say, don't even bother to fertilize your house plant if you're using an over-the-counter potting soil. Most of these soils have slow-release fertilizer in them that is sufficient for plant growth,” says Wheat. If you have an older plant with tired soil, or a particularly “heavy feeder,” you can opt for a slow or controlled-release fertilizer—or just repot it with fresh soil. (But be aware that winter isn't usually the best time to repot a plant, and you may want to wait until the growing season arrives.) “Keep it gentle,” advises Anderson. “If you do feed, make it a weak solution once a month, just enough to keep the leaves green.” Mutalik says there are just a few exceptions. “We pause all fertilizing during the winter dormancy period, unless a plant is actively growing (like some pothos or philodendrons that surprise us).” He says that feeding a dormant plant stresses it out, similarly to overwatering, and can cause leaf burn or browning edges. “If you really want to fertilize, and the leaves are actively being pushed out, dilute the fertilizer to one-fourth and add it to the base right after watering and flushing the soil.” (Editor Kat Merck uses and recommends the fertilizer above.) Over winter, what you want is a stable, calm plant. “If any of the leaves are turning yellow or the soil smells nasty, those are bad signs,” says Connolly. And if you do notice something going awry, it's best to make small adjustments rather than throwing the book of problem-solving at your houseplants. Gradual changes are the best way to help a plant bounce back, rather than risking stressing it further. There are even apps that claim to help you figure out what's wrong with your plants. (I'm testing a few out and will recommend one in an upcoming guide.) I'll let Wheat take it from here. “Don’t worry. Take it easy. Stop trying so hard. Winter gives way to spring and your plants go through cycles where they make look ‘happy’ or ’sad’ but it’s all part of any plant’s natural lifecycle. Be patient—but attentive—and you’ll see your plants thrive.” Power up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

    "content": "Some of the most urgent films at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival aren’t here to soothe. Together, Orwell: 2+2=5, Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, and Frankenstein play like sizzle reels of caution, and at their best, they’re award-worthy symbols of alarm. These films, the first two of which are documentaries, don’t just entertain—they confront fractured humanity, closeness and distance under Israel’s siege of Gaza, and a creation we’ve set loose, growing beyond our control. That’s the one muscle of film—to interrogate rather than facilitate. Director Raoul Peck, who gave us 2016’s I Am Not Your Negro, didn’t make Orwell: 2+2=5 to feel like a documentary in the usual sense—it’s a dare, the sort of blunt truth authoritarian regimes treat like contraband. The film portrays a slow-creep march around authoritarianism, not from an academic distance, but as an unsettling, visceral lesson in the here and now. Picture British actor Damian Lewis reading George Orwell’s final musings—his letters, essays, diaries—with an almost clinical cadence. These reflections are layered over raw, jarring images: Gaza in ruins, Donald Trump’s distorted truths, and the online mechanics of misinformation that enable our tendencies to ignore the unimaginable. “That’s unfortunately our capacity … to forget, our capacity to repress,” says Peck, who was born in Haiti, a country shaped by authoritarian rule. “Hitler wrote a book, Mein Kampf. He said exactly what he was going to do, and he did exactly what was written there. And yet the whole German society, the whole European society, did not believe him—they felt he was a joke.” “They thought, well, we will control him. They thought, well, our modern world cannot go that far down. We cannot imagine genocide going on. But it was written,” he continues. To that end, the film is less of an appeal to our sense of what we might already know than a critique of our numbness to it. Optically, it’s haunting. Words such as “doublespeak” (language designed to obscure or mislead), “newspeak” (a controlled vocabulary to limit thought), “thoughtcrime” (the criminalization of dissenting ideas), and “freedom is slavery” (the manipulation of truth to enforce obedience) populate the screen, overlaid on contemporary images of conflict, political spectacle, and media manipulation. Peck discovered Orwell through a kindred perspective. “Orwell grew up in the exterior of that world,” he says. “So his view and his analysis—I could find myself through that. I discovered Orwell as a brother, and that was an important connection because it was visceral. It was human.” For Peck, Orwell’s essays, particularly “Why I Write,” revealed a writer’s consciousness of his role in confronting injustice—a sensibility that informs every frame of Orwell: 2+2=5. Infographics lay bare uncomfortable truths: the widening gap between the rich and the rest, and the contrast between government promises and Gaza’s destruction. But it’s not just about relaying facts—social media and AI shape what we believe and forget. Peck frames Orwell in the digital age: “It’s basically Orwell’s world with the instruments to do it easier today. How can you manipulate? How can you gain power and control everything? Authoritarian terrorism means that you want to rewrite history. Now, with fake news, you rewrite history with a click. Just give a prompt and you’ve created a different path.” He stresses that Orwell’s analysis was grounded in real regimes, not prophecy: “You just apply it to your current situation, and redo the analysis.” In other words, the film forces us—beautifully, uncomfortably—to face what we’d rather deny: that a writer, equal parts truth and fiction teller, could imagine a future that now feels like our present. Our self-portrait is stitched not just from Orwell’s sly warnings about power, but from the nightmare we still insist is only fiction. “They flood you with information, with lies, action, arresting people in the streets, make you afraid,” adds Peck. “They terrorize, and you know, it’s working. That’s an incredible assault.” Where Orwell: 2+2=5 warns us about the apathy toward authoritarianism, Farsi’s Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk forces us to confront the daily realities of living under military control—specifically, in Gaza. In early 2024, Iranian-born director Sepideh Farsi arrived in Cairo, notebooks of intention in hand, only to find Gaza’s gates closed to her. A Palestinian refugee suggests she call Fatma Hassouna, a 24-year-old photographer in Gaza. Through her camera and voice, Farsi discovered the only window she could open. “I have never had such a deep relationship with someone whom I’ve never met … this feeling of being blocked in a country you cannot leave,” Farsi tells WIRED. “Then it’s just the magic of encounter, the human alchemy, and her smile was contagious.” Put Your Soul plays out as more than a record of someone’s life during the course of a brutal military siege; the war and the persistence of a single life are one and the same. It purports that genocide, and all that enables it, always seeks one thing: erasure. But Hassouna’s smile, threading its way entirely through video calls and fractured connections over the course of 112 minutes, renders that goal impossible. The opening shots of Hassouna and Farsi introducing themselves anchor the film in this perspective, which not only feels personal but very social. There are talks of dreams, of travelling to fashion shows, her hopes of the war ending, while Farsi occasionally interrupts and muses to Hassouna about the wanderings of her own household cat. Through the film, Hassouna comes alive not just as a photographer but as a witness to life insisting itself into being. She sings, writes, and frames the world in small, stubborn flashes of beauty—sunsets, gestures, moments that flicker and hold. Israel’s weight presses in, but in her eyes, and in her lens, you feel resilience not as heroism, but as a relentless survival. Their conversations flicker in and out—bad connections, cut-offs, pixelated resolutions. Farsi embraced the glitches as part of the film’s life, letting audiences feel her frustration and the strangeness of connecting with Gaza. “By keeping these pauses and disconnections, I’m conveying something very strange about the way we connect to Gaza, because Gaza is not reachable, and yet it is. It’s like another planet.” Making the film for Farsi was much like living in two worlds at once: recording Hassouna from afar, sure, but also being closely present as a friend, witness, and human being. “We were both in the process of filming and being filmed, kind of,” she reflects. “I had to remain natural, but also somehow controlled as a filmmaker. Because, of course, I needed to be able to react in the right way to her.” The film, in that sense, is a strong picture of Palestinian humanity—something mainstream media outlets have historically failed to portray—as shown through Hassouna. But it’s a reckoning film as well. As months pass, Farsi and Hassouna’s conversations confront the harsh realities of life under siege: constant bombings, sniper fire, days without food, as told by Hassouna. Sometimes she forgets the questions, her attention slipping due to the toll of hunger, with Farsi always keeping her at the center. “I did not want to include graphic images in Gaza or raw footage in this film. I had to concentrate on the human facing me in a different way,” says Farsi. “There is a virtue to show, and if we do not, how would people find out about it?” Farsi remembers Hassouna’s smile—playful, melancholy, in poetry or sunlight. Even in hunger or fatigue, she would smile. “Absolutely unforgettable, her smile,” adds Farsi. Put Your Soul offers no tidy closure by the end of its run time—because there is none to give. On April 16, 2025, just a day after the film’s Cannes selection, Hassouna was killed with 10 family members, including her pregnant sister, in an Israeli airstrike on their home in Gaza City’s Al-Tuffah neighborhood. Her death renders the film both as a memorial and an indictment. As Farsi reflects, “When the film was finished, I thought that together we had achieved something. And then she was taken away and killed in a targeted and horrible way. I really travel a lot with the film, and it’s weird to be presenting it alone without Fatim to talk about her in such an intense way. I’m there to kind of represent both of us.” Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein puts creation under the microscope. Frankenstein isn’t just about science and monsters; it’s a haunting intersection of ambition and humanity. Like Mary Shelley before him, del Toro revives a tortured genius, where monstrosity and humanity are kin. Oscar Isaac’s Victor Frankenstein sheds the simplicity of villainy, revealing the messy truths of a man who is both creator and creature. As Del Toro told Variety at Cannes in May: “Somebody asked me the other day, does it have really scary scenes? For the first time, I considered that. It’s an emotional story for me. It’s as personal as anything. I’m asking a question about being a father, being a son … I’m not doing a horror movie—ever. I’m not trying to do that.” Del Toro reanimates the well-worn tale of science gone unchecked and ambition outpacing our capacity to reckon. Gothic-darkened labs and ornate wardrobes frame the creature (Jacob Elordi), whose scars are smoothed, jawline sculpted—calibrated for sympathy. Del Toro doesn’t revive Shelley’s horror; he asks viewers to feel for a creation that should repel them. To be clear, much of Frankenstein is theatrical as hell, balancing Shelley’s lessons with the sentimental flourish of a Del Toro signature. It leans on familiar motifs of forgiveness and our capacity to self-correct, sometimes without fully earning these moments. Again, Frankenstein is not an explicit message movie like the two above, but it is in Hollywood form, sounding an alarm during the in-between flashiness of a big studio film. Like Frankenstein, who stitched life from what should not live, we now hover on the edge of our own experiment, with AI promising to remake the world in ways that terrify, seduce, and elude our moral imagination. Like Victor, who’s warned about the dangers of his inner Prometheus by love interest Elizabeth Lavenza (Mia Goth), the architects of our artificial minds—the Sam Altmans, Demis Hassabis, Elon Musks—move in a space between awe and terror, crafting intelligences that mirror us back with uncanny precision, and with a threat that feels both abstract and immediate. They are our modern Frankensteins, not in horror but in the quiet, insistent way their creations compel reflection. And yet it’s the film’s insistence on the creature’s interiority that lingers. Elordi’s Frankenstein is alive not only in body but in feeling, in gesture, in the way he occupies space as both product and probe of his maker’s ambition. It forces us to reckon with the weight of creation, to sit with the responsibility of what we bring into being. Frankenstein doesn’t lecture on AI whatsoever. But in the shadow of ChatGPT, AlphaFold, and Neuralink, it’s hard to miss an allegory that wouldn’t apply to any other decade: the exhilaration of invention, the seduction of power, and the precariousness of a life—artificial or otherwise—that escapes our grasp, demanding we consider what it means to make, to care for, and to witness what we make and enable.",

See All by Terrence O'Brien Disclosure: Penske Media Corporation is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company. Penske Media Corporation, the publisher of Rolling Stone and The Hollywood Reporter, has become the first major American media company to sue Google over its AI summaries. The company claims that the AI Overviews that often appear at the top of search results leave users with little reason to click through to the source, hurting traffic and illegally benefitting from the work of its reporters. While Penske Media is the biggest name to take on Google over its AI Overviews, it’s not the first. Online education company Chegg sued Google in February, as did a group of independent publishers in Europe. The News / Media Alliance has also spoken out about the feature, calling it the “definition of theft” and seeking action from the DOJ. Google spokesperson José Castañeda defended the summaries to the Wall Street Journal saying, “with AI Overviews, people find search more helpful and use it more.” But Penske and other publishers say there is little reason to follow the links provided in search results and, as a result, they have seen significant drops in traffic and revenue. Penske claims in the suit that revenue from affiliate links is down by over 1/3 this year, and it attributes that directly to a drop in traffic from Google. The company also claims it’s in a tough situation. It can either block Google from indexing its content, essentially removing itself from all search results, which would further devastate its business. Or, it can continue to provide training material to Google for its AI, “adding fuel to a fire that threatens PMC’s [Penske Media Corporation] entire publishing business,” the complaint states, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is, of course, just the latest battle between AI companies and the creators of the content they harvest. Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster recently sued Perplexity, as did News Corp last year. Meanwhile Microsoft and OpenAI have found themselves in the crosshairs of the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and others. Google might also have a tougher time defending itself now that it’s been forced to admit that “the open web is already in rapid decline,” as it faces multiple antitrust complaints.

See All by Terrence O'Brien Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. See All by Terrence O'Brien “Yesterday was an interesting day for the Helldivers community.” That’s the very obvious understatement that announced the reopening of the Helldivers gaming subreddit in the small hours of Saturday morning. On Friday it was discovered that Tyler Robinson, arrested for the alleged killing of Charlie Kirk, had inscribed messages on the casings of several bullets found at the crime scene. One of those read “Hey fascist! Catch!” accompanied by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow, and three down arrows, a reference to the code to call down the 500KG Bomb stratagem in the cooperative shooter Helldivers 2. Unsurprisingly, within minutes the official subreddit and Discord servers were thrown into chaos. Moderators quickly locked the Helldivers subreddit, pointing to a high number of posts that violated its rule against “Real-World Political Discussions.” Similarly, references to Robinson, Kirk, or the 500KG Bomb stratagem were quickly deleted on the Discord server, and some users speculated the code had been flagged for autodeletion. (Arrowhead Game Studios, makers of the Helldivers series, hasn’t released a public statement about the incident and didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Users merely asking why the subreddit was locked were shut down — “We are not allowed to discuss, I would suggest looking elsewhere,” one user was told. Online and in conversations with The Verge, Helldivers fans mostly seemed confused and a little concerned about what might come along with all of this sudden attention. “I just don’t want to see a community I love get slandered to no fault of their own,” one Discord user, Inferionix, wrote. Helldivers is hardly the first piece of media tied to an act of violence; the Columbine High School shooting famously put an unwelcome spotlight on Doom as commentators searched for a meaning behind the attack. But Kirk’s slaying inspired widespread calls for retaliatory violence by Republicans, making the still-ongoing search for Robinson’s motive particularly high-stakes. Even discussing it is risky, as lawmakers and right-wing tycoon Elon Musk are surveilling social media to police social media users’ responses to Kirk’s death, demanding firings at employers including Microsoft. The subreddit mods said in their reopening post that nobody was banned during the initial flood of shooting-related comments, but anyone who discusses it in the future will be. One brief bastion where fans of the game could share their feelings was the Helldivers 2 subreddit, which doesn’t have the same strict ban on real life political discussions. A megathread there, at least for a while, was filled mostly was fans marveling at just how surreal the situation was. “Waking up and hearing a sitting governor of the United States say ‘Notices bulge OwO whats this?’ was a goddamn flashbang,” Reddit user Snaxwheels wrote, referring to one of the other, non-Helldivers-related inscriptions. But eventually that thread was also removed after moderators felt it had gotten out of hand. Some posters there expressed concern that the attention could reignite the culture war around violent video games. One even pointed out that RFK Jr. had recently revived a largely dismissed theory linking violent games to school shootings. Isadora, an active community member who spoke with The Verge, was more dubious. “Givin [sic] the short news cycles and the fact that such a large portion of MAGAs youth base are among the [conservative games streamer] Asmongold/gamergate type I don’t see the admin and its media machine coming super hard against the game itself.” One outstanding question is what — if anything — Robinson thought about Helldiver’s politics. The series, which draws from Robert Heinlein’s Starship Troopers and Paul Verhoeven’s film adaptation, is a satire where players take the role of brainwashed military grunts fighting to spread “managed democracy” for a quasi-fascist Super Earth government. Isadora calls the gameplay the biggest draw, but “its politics is what made me fall in love with it,” they said. “I’m a big Paul Verhoeven fan and Starship Troopers was one of my favorites.” As with other satires on authoritarianism, like Warhammer 40K, there’s a persistent discussion about whether some players get the joke. Isadora, largely, thinks they do. “I’m sad that this community has been drug into this as I think the game’s ironic criticism of fascism is a great outlet for so many people,” they told The Verge. “It reflects negatively on a community that largely understands the criticisms it lays out.”Helldivers will almost certainly go down as a footnote in Kirk’s death. But for some players, the strangeness of using the 500KG Bomb combo — or having it as a tattoo — might linger. One Redditor suggested starting a petition to encourage Arrowhead to change the button command. Most disagreed, littering his message with thumbs down and big red X reactions. “Please don’t bring it here,” said the only reply.

TIFF 2025 reviews: Scarlet, Project Y, and Sentimental Value. Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. See All by Andrew Webster Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. See All by Andrew Webster Well, I was wrong, and I did manage to make it to one last day at the Toronto International Film Festival. One of the movies I wanted to see the most this year was Scarlet, the latest from Mamoru Hosoda, whose most recent film was the metaverse fairy tale Belle. Whereas that film was a reimagining of Beauty and the Beast, Scarlet is a twist on Hamlet that’s full of bold, creative ideas. I mostly enjoyed it, but unfortunately it’s saddled with an ending that doesn’t really fit. I also managed to squeeze in two other films: a Korean revenge / heist thriller, and a Norwegian film about connecting through art. You can read my thoughts on all three below. And that’s a wrap on TIFF 2025. Coincidentally, I managed to watch and write about a total of 25 movies this year, and aside from a few duds, it’s been a blast. Things look bright for Netflix with the likes of Wake Up Dead Man and Frankenstein (though I wish everyone had the option to watch them in theaters), Arco might be the year’s most gorgeous animated feature, and Park Chan-wook is back in form with No Other Choice. And if you missed it, I also had a chance to talk to director Genki Kawamura about his fascinating adaption of the cult horror game Exit 8. That’s a lot to squeeze into one festival, and I appreciate everyone who followed along. Now I’m gonna take a nap. Even though the opening makes it clear everything turns out relatively OK, Project Y remains riveting and unpredictable throughout. It starts out as a heist movie. Two best friends (Han So-hee and Jun Jong-seo) have worked hard for years and are about to retire from their awful jobs for good, but then they run into a sequence of scams that completely wipe out their savings. So when they hear about a hidden cache of cash, they can’t resist. They get caught, of course, and the film shifts into revenge mode. There are a few implausible moments along the way, but Project Y has an unrelenting kind of tension that’s strengthened by an absolutely vicious villain (Kim Sung-cheol). Just be warned: there are some very gruesome torture sequences. No word yet on a wider theatrical release. Scarlet (Mana Ashida) is a young princess in 16th century Denmark who finds her life turned upside down when her uncle kills her father to take the crown for himself. The set-up is basically Hamlet, but the twist is that much of the film takes place in the afterlife. It’s a space known as the “otherworld” — neither heaven nor hell, but instead a wasteland where people struggle to get by, and a massive, ancient dragon prowls the skies smiting people with bolts of lightning. The fantasy element of the film is strong, as is Scarlet’s single-minded quest for revenge. But the film unravels towards the end, with a happy ending that feels very out of place. In theaters in Japan on November 21st; no word yet on a global theatrical release. Sisters Nora (Renate Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas) try to come to grips with a troubled childhood after their mostly absentee father Gustav (Stellan Skarsgard) reenters their lives following their mother’s death. It’s an understated but powerful film from Worst Person in the World director Joachim Trier, and it happens in part through understanding trauma through art, as Gustav is a legendary film director attempting to make his most personal movie yet. Sentimental Value is filled with gut punch moments like when Nora asks her sibling “why didn’t our childhood ruin you?” But it brings it all together in a way that feels genuinely hopeful and touching. In theaters on November 7th. Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.

See All by Ash Parrish I would not call the time I’m having with Hollow Knight: Silksong “fun,” and yet I’m still playing. In the depths of The Marrow, the second major area of Silksong, there’s a particularly nasty midboss. I eventually beat him, but my reward wasn’t a new ability, item, or a bench where I could rest and save my progress. All I got was pain, suffering, and death. In Silksong, the only way out is through, but the “through” is a tunnel lined with spikes that occasionally spew gouts of flame. I should have given up right then and there, but I have not abandoned Silksong the same way I do other unfun games. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why I didn’t just put Silksong down and chalk it up as another “not for me” game the way Hollow Knight just wasn’t for me. I enjoy Metroidvanias a great deal — Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was one of my favorite games of last year. And for Silksong, I wanted to try Team Cherry’s work again and see if it would finally click. It has, and it’s because of the community (and a lot of spite). I came to Hollow Knight late, long after the buzz about it had left my social media circle. With Silksong, I’m playing it at the same time as everyone else. My social media feed is full of people who love the game much more than I do, posting tips, commiserating about its moments of bullshit (hello, lantern fruit pogo platforming), and gushing over the adorable Sherma. “I have only known Sherma for a day and a half…” When I post lamenting the game’s bullshit, I get excited messages from my friends giving me advice on what I should do next. It’s like we’re all doing our own personal let’s plays together while being in each other’s chats. It feels good. I am not alone in my misery, and better yet, I’ve got friends to help. For Silksong it’s worked in such a way that’s kept me playing longer than I would have if I were going this alone. This kind of collective, collaborative gaming experience has also taught me a new trick: taking a break. I’ve never been the kind of gamer that stops playing when I can’t overcome an obstacle. I either do something else in the game or keep running at my problem until I figure it out. Now, when I feel myself getting even the slightest bit mad because I was so close (or I thought I was so close) to surmounting a challenge, I turn off the game and come back later. It’s so silly that, once again, the “touch grass” people are right, but the strategy has gotten me through some of the game’s most egregious moments. (If the vendor Shakra wants to leave her post in Greymoor because of something I did, that’s fine. But taking her bench with her that’s in a room right before a brutal combat gauntlet is a unique and dastardly flavor of Silksong bullshit.) And when I overcome that bullshit, I get this incredible frisson of thrill. When I easily beat a boss in fewer tries than I’m used to, I feel godly. I’m actually quite tickled to hear Team Cherry is working to nerf some of the early bosses, because those were fine. (It’s the damn pogo platforming!) I’m pretty sure I’m going to finish Silksong and whatever I feel at the end of that journey will be more like relief than joy. Silksong has shown me I don’t need to feel “happiness” or “joy” to continue playing a game. I just want to feel something — even if that something is pure spite.

The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here. Smartphone batteries are bigger than ever, while the phones themselves are shrinking. But whether you’re seeing the benefit — thin phones with big batteries — depends on where you live. The key is the introduction of silicon-carbon batteries, which make it possible to fit more battery capacity into the same size cell, as in phones like the Honor Power, whose 8,000mAh battery delivers more power than some iPads. The flip side of that is putting the same capacity into much smaller cells, seen in the likes of the Oppo Find N5, a foldable phone that’s as extraordinarily thin as Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 but has a 5,600mAh battery that wouldn’t be out of place in an Ultra-sized flagship. Honor and Oppo aren’t the only companies on board. Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo, OnePlus, Nothing, and more have all released phones using silicon-carbon batteries. It’s not just phones, either; Whoop wearables have used silicon-carbon batteries since 2021 thanks to a partnership with Sila Nanotechnologies, and EV manufacturers from General Motors to Porsche have invested heavily in the technology. But you’ve probably noticed some pretty big names missing from that list — none of Apple, Samsung, and Google, the three major players in the US phone market, have embraced the new batteries yet. That’s despite the fact that between Samsung and Google’s foldable phones, and super-slim models like the newly announced iPhone Air, the possible applications are immediately obvious. “Silcon-carbon batteries” is arguably a bit of a misnomer, because these don’t replace lithium batteries — they’re a subset of them. In the broadest strokes, the bulk of a battery is made up of two parts, the cathode and the anode, and it’s the movement of ions between the two that either charges or discharges the cell. In most modern batteries, the cathode is lithium-based, while the anode uses graphite. It’s that bit that silicon-carbon batteries change, using a blend of silicon and graphite for the anode. Silicon has almost 10 times the energy density of graphite, so just a little goes a long way — Honor’s recent Magic V5 foldable is the first to replace 15 percent of the graphite with silicon, and other phones have used as little as 5 percent. More silicon means better battery capacity in the same space, so the race is on to push those numbers up. The reason manufacturers can’t go all in and swap all the graphite for silicon is that its energy density comes with one big downside: longevity. When graphite anodes absorb lithium ions during charging, they expand just a little. When silicon anodes absorb those same ions, they expand quite a lot more. Over time, those repeated expansions and contractions damage the battery’s structure, contributing to the decline in battery life you’ll be familiar with if you’ve ever hung onto the same phone for more than a few years. That anode expansion isn’t the same as the swelling that causes batteries to burst out of phones’ bodies, but is one of a few factors that can contribute to it. Simply put: silicon anodes allow for batteries that are much denser, but don’t last as long. And we don’t have a lot of real-world evidence for how bad this problem really is, since the first phone with a silicon-carbon battery, the Honor Magic 5 Pro, only launched in 2023. That might be one reason why we haven’t seen Apple, Samsung, and Google jump on board. All three make long-term product support one of their selling points, so switching to batteries that might die off early wouldn’t be a great look. Then there are EU regulations, which now require smartphone batteries to retain 80 percent of their capacity after 800 charging cycles. Silicon battery manufacturer Group14 says its batteries meet that threshold, but it’s still an area where tech giants are likely to be cautious. There are also question marks around how big they want their batteries to get anyway. International shipping regulations add stringent requirements — and “dangerous goods” labels — for battery cells larger than 20Wh, which at a standard voltage of 3.7W equates to around 5,400mAh. Batteries bigger than that cost more to ship, especially by air, which is a good incentive to stay just below that line. Even the larger Chinese OEMs are limited by this — the Nothing Phone 3 includes a huge 5,500mAh battery if you buy it in India, but the European version has a 5,150mAh cell instead — below the line where shipping charges go up. This is just one of countless examples of a regional split in battery sizes, with OnePlus even admitting to Android Authority that rules around shipping were to blame for its Nord CE4 Lite bringing a smaller battery to Europe. With silicon-carbon batteries first introduced into phones two years ago, we’re reaching the point where manufacturers can get a sense of the real-world longevity of the power cells. If there are problems, they might rein themselves in a little, but if not you should expect things to get more extreme from here. Expect silicon percentages to push up, next to 20 percent and then beyond, until whenever the diminishing returns kick in. That will mean bigger and bigger batteries in “regular” phones — Oppo has confirmed that its next flagship, the Find X9 Pro, will offer a 7,500mAh battery in China, and it’s been rumored that the Honor Power 2 will go even further, with a battery as big as 10,000mAh, twice the size of some power banks. At the other end of the spectrum, dupes of the iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge are surely on the way, and will no doubt tout bigger batteries than either while staying just as thin. The real question is if, and when, Apple, Google, and Samsung will jump on board. While one strand of silicon-carbon battery development is pushing for higher proportions of silicon, others are experimenting with ways to reduce the downsides. I expect this is what these three have their eye on, waiting to be sure that the compromises are minimal, just as they have with their slow adoption of faster charging speeds. Expect Samsung in particular to be cautious — it’s spent the last nine years fearing a repeat of its exploding Note 7 debacle, and is in no rush to risk one, telling T3 that while it’s researching silicon batteries, it places “a little more priority on the reliability.” Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.

Huge, huge thanks to Jay Peters for doing such a fabulous job here over the last couple of months, and huge thanks to all of you as always for having such good contributions and ideas. Jay will still be around these parts from time to time, too, so don’t worry, your esoteric gaming recommendations aren’t going anywhere. I was going to do a whole “all the cool stuff I caught up on this summer” thing, but then it turned out I had a newborn baby, so all I had brainpower for was Entourage and Veep episodes on repeat. But this week, I’ve been reading about AI doctors and face-lift culture and Glen Powell and Lofi Girl, watching The Paper (which I really liked as soon as I stopped wanting it to be The Office), playing the latest season of NFL Retro Bowl, marveling at the engineering inside AirPods, being continually impressed with Notion AI, continuing to throw my life’s notes and nonsense into Craft, and suddenly getting ready to move houses. Pray for my sanity. I also have for you the best things that Apple launched this week, a new way to watch everyone’s favorite game show, a Stephen King movie worth seeing, and much more. We’re so back, y’all. Let’s do this.(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you watching / reading / playing / downloading / getting out for the fall this week? Tell me everything: [email protected]. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.) You could probably ascribe a large part of my personality to a specific era of the website Lifehacker. Back in the day, it was this breezy, fun, curious, and self-aware blog about how to use technology and explore the internet and just be a person in the future. And for a long time, it was all coming out of the brain of Gina Trapani, one of the internet’s great bloggers. Gina’s been up to lots of stuff in recent years, but now she’s blogging again! Her site, Note to Self, was an instant subscribe for me — and if you like Installer, then I suspect you’ll like it, too. When I saw the site launch, I reached out to Gina to see how a true lifehacker does a homescreen in 2025. Here’s Gina’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why: The phone: Right now, I’ve got a four-year-old iPhone 13 Pro, which means I’m looking forward to upgrading this year. Once you get three to four years of mileage out of your phone, when you do finally trade up, the latest model feels absolutely heavenly, and I appreciate it more. The wallpaper: This is Apple’s 2025 Pride wallpaper, which I grabbed in June and haven’t updated since. I like what Apple did with the Pride designs this year — they managed to make something fresh but recognizable. The apps: Camera, Settings. People who know me from Lifehacker will expect me to have a tricked-out setup with all the hot new apps, and I’m here to disappoint. I’ve been in touch-grass mode for a while; I want my preteen to see more of me than the top of my head while I look down at my phone. So my homescreen is minimal and utilitarian. I’ve turned off almost all those horrendous red badges; I feel conflicted about using AI instead of my brain. I keep a small number of my most frequently used apps on my homescreen, and almost all of them are grouped into purpose-related folders, like Communication, Health & Fitness, Travel. That adds another tap to get to them, but the extra step helps me be intentional about what I set out to do. For everything else, I pull down the search bar to find it. I’m a big note-taker, and I use Obsidian, so I have an iOS shortcut called “Note.” It’s a direct link to an Obsidian note called “Inbox,” where I capture stuff to process later. In Health & Fitness, I’ve got a triathlon training app I vibe-coded on Lovable, driven by a personal Google Sheet. All it does is tell me one thing: whether I’m supposed to run, bike, or swim at the gym that day. As it turns out, I’m nearly five decades old and need a teeth-brushing coach. The Oral-B app paired with my electric toothbrush gamifies things, which works for me. It helps me get pressure and coverage right, and my full two minutes of brushing in because I won’t otherwise. Superhuman is better than Gmail. Todoist is for deadlines. Citymapper is my favorite way to navigate New York City. Monarch is my where-does-the-money-go app. Checking ebooks out of the library with Libby brings me much joy. I also asked Gina to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back: Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email [email protected] or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For more great recommendations, check out this post on Threads, this post on Bluesky, and this post on The Verge. “I ‘inherited’ my daughter’s Nintendo Switch and got Demon Slayer: The Hinomaki Chronicles on sale for $20. Getting myself hyped up for the movie this weekend.” – Michael “Stephen Robles on YouTube has created an amazing iOS shortcut that can help protect your iPhone if it’s ever stolen. It sends you the location of your device along with photos from both the front and back cameras. It even plays an audible alert that says, ‘This iPhone is stolen!’ Best of all, you can activate it from any phone, whether Android or iOS.” — Owen “I just started Frieren and man, the hype is warranted. I’m more of a rom-com, slice of life guy rather than fantasy, but the story is super compelling so far.” — Ryan “I have been thoroughly enjoying Bill McKibben’s Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization. Its thesis — that the astoundingly rapid buildout of solar and wind could provide us a lifeline out of the worst effects of climate change, if we act now — has brought more hope and enthusiasm about the future than I’ve felt in what feels like years.” — Hoto “Currently checking out the beta of 2XKO, a free 2v2 tag-team fighting game set in the League of Legends universe. Appears to be great for newcomers.” — Daniel “I’m cautiously enjoying a new feature on the Garmin Forerunner 955. A recent software update ties in my travel plans to the watch, and I get recommendations for time zone adjustments. It gave decent suggestions when I went from the US to Italy, back to the US, then to France all within a week. The gentle reminders of when to stop caffeine were the best.” — Sean “I binged and loved Long Story Short by the creator(s) of BoJack Horseman.” — Tal “1001 Albums Generator recommends a new album every day (including weekends if you like) from the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. It’s a great way to listen to some of the best-regarded music and expand your listening habits beyond your music recommendation algorithm.” — Richard“Alien: Earth. Let’s talk about the octopus eye.” — Sheila Okay, so there is one show I watched this summer that I want to talk about, just for a second. It’s a Netflix show called Building the Band, and it is essentially American Idol meets Love is Blind meets The Circle. The premise makes no sense! It also totally works. I found myself shockingly invested in all these singers and bands, and the whole thing is structured so that none of the 10 episodes ever feel repetitive or draggy. I would watch a thousand seasons of this show — and knowing Netflix, I assume that’s exactly what we’re going to get. And not to brag, but I called the winner with about four episodes to spare.

And while we caught a brief glimpse of him in action last year, the first proper clip from season 4 of the show reveals just how Hemsworth will be inhabiting the role — including his take on Geralt’s signature growling voice. In addition to giving us a better look at Geralt, Netflix also confirmed that The Witcher’s newest season is coming out pretty soon: it will start streaming on October 30th. The show’s end is in sight, as Netflix previously confirmed that it will conclude with season 5. Here’s the official setup for the next season: After the Continent-altering events of season 3, Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri find themselves separated by a raging war and countless enemies. As their paths diverge, and their goals sharpen, they stumble on unexpected allies eager to join their journeys. And if they can accept these found families, they just might have a chance at reuniting for good… The Witcher originally debuted in 2019 with Henry Cavill as Geralt, and his time on the show wrapped up in disappointing fashion in 2023. But Netflix has been trying hard to turn the franchise into something bigger than a single series, with spinoffs like an animated film and a live-action prequel with Michelle Yeoh. Meanwhile, developer CD Projekt Red has a fourth Witcher game in the works, this time with Ciri in the lead role.

This, plus a somewhat fraught political atmosphere, means that you might be looking for reliable, affordable ways to escape the doldrums. You don’t need us to tell you that a way to do that is by watching some movies and TV shows. Through September 18th, Paramount is offering a doozy of a deal on both tiers of its Plus streaming service. You can save 50 percent on an annual subscription to Paramount Plus Essential, or its mostly ad-free Premium plan. The Essential Plan is down to $29.99 (from $59.99) and a Premium plan goes to $59.99 (from $119.99). The neat thing is that you can take advantage of this whether you’re a new or a returning subscriber (but be careful to mark your calendar; it will renew after that year at full price). Essential gets you ad-supported access to TV shows and movies. You won’t be able to download content, but you get many of the same benefits as Premium. The Premium tier allows for downloads, and content can be viewed without ads (except during live TV). You’ll also get access to Showtime series and CBS. It’s a tempting deal, whether you go for the ad-supported Essential or the skip-the-ads Premium. The latter also lets you download your shows, which could be very handy when you’re traveling with kids, and from its library of Showtime Originals. Either way, you not only get recent shows like Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the entire Yellowstone catalog, Top Gun: Maverick, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, and Bob Marley: One Love, but animation series like South Park and SpongeBob Squarepants, and live NFL games. Also, it hosts every Mission Impossible movie, aside from the latest one, The Final Reckoning. Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

    "content": "The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a flash alert to release indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with two cybercriminal groups tracked as UNC6040 and UNC6395 for a string of data theft and extortion attacks. \"Both groups have recently been observed targeting organizations' Salesforce platforms via different initial access mechanisms,\" the FBI said. UNC6395 is a threat group that has been attributed a widespread data theft campaign targeting Salesforce instances in August 2025 by exploiting compromised OAuth tokens for the Salesloft Drift application. In an update issued this week, Salesloft said the attack was made possible due to the breach of its GitHub account from March through June 2025. As a result of the breach, Salesloft has isolated the Drift infrastructure and taken the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot application offline. The company also said it's in the process of implementing new multi-factor authentication processes and GitHub hardening measures. \"We are focused on the ongoing hardening of the Drift Application environment,\" the company said. \"This process includes rotating credentials, temporarily disabling certain parts of the Drift application and strengthening security configurations.\" \"At this time, we are advising all Drift customers to treat any and all Drift integrations and related data as potentially compromised.\" The second group the FBI has called attention to is UNC6040. Assessed to be active since October 2024, UNC6040 is the name assigned by Google to a financially motivated threat cluster that has engaged in vishing campaigns to obtain initial access and hijack Salesforce instances for large-scale data theft and extortion. These attacks have involved the use of a modified version of Salesforce's Data Loader application and custom Python scripts to breach victims' Salesforce portals and exfiltrate valuable data. At least some of the incidents have involved extortion activities following UNC6040 intrusions, with them taking place months after the initial data theft. \"UNC6040 threat actors have utilized phishing panels, directing victims to visit from their mobile phones or work computers during the social engineering calls,\" the FBI said. \"After obtaining access, UNC6040 threat actors have then used API queries to exfiltrate large volumes of data in bulk.\" The extortion phase has been attributed by Google to another uncategorized cluster tracked as UNC6240, which has consistently claimed to be the ShinyHunters group in emails and calls to employees of victim organizations. \"In addition, we believe threat actors using the 'ShinyHunters' brand may be preparing to escalate their extortion tactics by launching a data leak site (DLS),\" Google noted last month. \"These new tactics are likely intended to increase pressure on victims, including those associated with the recent UNC6040 Salesforce-related data breaches.\" Since then, there have been a flurry of developments, the most notable being the teaming up of ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and LAPSUS$ to consolidate and unify their criminal efforts. Then on September 12, 2025, the group claimed on their Telegram channel \"scattered LAPSUS$ hunters 4.0\" that they are shutting down. \"We LAPSUS$, Trihash, Yurosh, Yaxsh, WyTroZz, N3z0x, Nitroz, TOXIQUEROOT, Prosox, Pertinax, Kurosh, Clown, IntelBroker, Scattered Spider, Yukari and among many others, have decided to go dark,\" the group said. \"Our objectives having been fulfilled, it is now time to say goodbye.\" It's currently not clear what prompted the group to hang up their boots, but it's possible that the move is an attempt to lay low and avoid further law enforcement attention. \"The newly formed scattered LAPSUS$ hunters 4.0 group said it's hanging up the boots and 'go dark' after it alleged that French law enforcement arrested another wrong person in connection with the cybercrime group,\" Sam Rubin, senior vice president of Unit 42 Consulting and Threat Intelligence, told The Hacker News. \"These declarations rarely signal a true retirement.\" \"Recent arrests may have prompted the group to lay low, but history tells us this is often temporary. Groups like this splinter, rebrand, and resurface – much like ShinyHunters. Even if public operations pause, the risks remain: stolen data can resurface, undetected backdoors may persist, and actors may re-emerge under new names. Silence from a threat group does not equal safety. Organizations must stay vigilant and operate under the assumption that the threat has not disappeared, only adapted.\"",

The agency said the alerts were sent out on September 3, 2025, making it the fourth time this year that Apple has notified citizens in the county that at least one of the devices linked to their iCloud accounts may have been compromised as part of highly-targeted attacks. The agency did not share further details on what triggered these alerts. Previous threat notifications were sent on March 5, April 29, and June 25. Apple has been sending these notices since November 2021. \"These complex attacks target individuals for their status or function: journalists, lawyers, activists, politicians, senior officials, members of steering committees of strategic sectors, etc,\" CERT-FR said. The development comes less than a month after it emerged that a security flaw in WhatsApp (CVE-2025-55177, CVSS score: 5.4) was chained with an Apple iOS bug (CVE-2025-43300, CVSS score: 8.8) as part of zero-click attacks. WhatsApp subsequently told The Hacker News that it had sent in-app threat notifications to less than 200 users who may have been targeted as part of the campaign. It's not known who, and which commercial spyware vendor, is behind the activity. The disclosure comes as Apple has introduced a security feature in the latest iPhone models called Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) to combat memory corruption vulnerabilities and make it harder for surveillance vendors, who typically rely on such zero-days for planting spyware on a target's phone. In a report published this week, the Atlantic Council said the number of United States investors in spyware and surveillance technologies jumped from 11 in 2023 to 31 last year, surpassing other major investing countries such as Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Altogether, the study has flagged two holding companies, 55 individuals, 34 investors, eighteen partners, seven subsidiaries, 10 suppliers, and four vendors that established themselves in the last year in the spyware marketplace. This includes new spyware entities in Japan, Malaysia, and Panama, as well as vendors like Israel's Bindecy and Italy's SIO. \"The quantity of U.S.-based entities investing in the spyware market is three times greater than in the next three highest countries with the most investors,\" the report said, adding \"56% of investors are incorporated in Israel, the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom.\" \"Tesellers and brokers now are key actors in the spyware market – comprising more sample market share than previously demonstrated – and oftentimes are under-observed and not readily addressed in current policy deliberations.\"",

    "content": "Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new ransomware strain dubbed HybridPetya that resembles the notorious Petya/NotPetya malware, while also incorporating the ability to bypass the Secure Boot mechanism in Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) systems using a now-patched vulnerability disclosed earlier this year. Slovakian cybersecurity company ESET said the samples were uploaded to the VirusTotal platform in February 2025. \"HybridPetya encrypts the Master File Table, which contains important metadata about all the files on NTFS-formatted partitions,\" security researcher Martin Smolár said. \"Unlike the original Petya/NotPetya, HybridPetya can compromise modern UEFI-based systems by installing a malicious EFI application onto the EFI System Partition.\" In other words, the deployed UEFI application is the central component that takes care of encrypting the Master File Table (MFT) file, which contains metadata related to all the files on the NTFS-formatted partition. HybridPetya comes with two main components: a bootkit and an installer, with the former appearing in two distinct versions. The bootkit, which is deployed by the installer, is chiefly responsible for loading its configuration and checking its encryption status. It can have three different values - Should the value be set to 0, it proceeds to set the flag to 1 and encrypts the \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\verify file with the Salsa20 encryption algorithm using the key and nonce specified in the configuration. It also creates a file called \"\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\counter\" on the EFI System Partition prior to launching the disk encryption process of all NTFS-formatted partitions. The file is used to keep track of the already encrypted disk clusters. Furthermore, the bootkit updates the fake CHKDSK message displayed on the victim's screen with information about the current encryption status, while the victim is deceived into thinking that the system is repairing disk errors. If the bootkit detects that the disk is already encrypted (i.e., the flag is set to 1), it serves a ransom note to the victim, demanding them to send $1,000 in Bitcoin to the specified wallet address (34UNkKSGZZvf5AYbjkUa2yYYzw89ZLWxu2). The wallet is currently empty, although it has received $183.32 between February and May 2025. The ransom note screen also provides an option for the victim to enter the deception key purchased from the operator after making the payment, following which the bootkit verifies the key and attempts to decrypt the \"EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\verify\" file. In the event the correct key is entered, the flag value is set to 2 and kicks off the decryption step by reading the contents of the \"\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\counter\" file. \"The decryption stops when the number of decrypted clusters is equal to the value from the counter file,\" Smolár said. \"During the process of MFT decryption, the bootkit shows the current decryption process status.\" The decryption phase also involves the bootkit recovering the legitimate bootloaders -- \"\\EFI\\Boot\\bootx64.efi\" and \"\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi\" -- from the backups previously created during the installation process. Once this step is complete, the victim is prompted to reboot their Windows machine. It's worth noting that bootloader changes initiated by the installer during the deployment of the UEFI bootkit component triggers a system crash (aka Blue Screen of Death or BSoD) and ensures that the bootkit binary is executed once the device is turned on. Select variants of HybridPetya, ESET added, have been found to exploit CVE‑2024‑7344 (CVSS score: 6.7), a remote code execution vulnerability in the Howyar Reloader UEFI application (\"reloader.efi\", renamed in the artifact as \"\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi\") that could result in a Secure Boot bypass. The variant also packs in a specially crafted file named \"cloak.dat,\" which is loadable through reloader.efi and contains the XORed bootkit binary. Microsoft has since revoked the old, vulnerable binary as part of its Patch Tuesday update for January 2025 update. \"When the reloader.efi binary (deployed as bootmgfw.efi) is executed during boot, it searches for the presence of the cloak.dat file on the EFI System Partition, and loads the embedded UEFI application from the file in a very unsafe way, completely ignoring any integrity checks, thus bypassing UEFI Secure Boot,\" ESET said. Another aspect where HybridPetya and NotPetya differ is that, unlike the latter's destructive capabilities, the newly identified artifact allows the threat actors to reconstruct the decryption key from the victim's personal installation keys. Telemetry data from ESET indicates no evidence of HybridPetya being used in the wild. The cybersecurity company also pointed out the recent discovery of a UEFI Petya Proof-of-Concept (PoC) by security researcher Aleksandra \"Hasherezade\" Doniec, adding it's possible there could be \"some relationship between the two cases.\" However, it doesn't rule out the possibility that HybridPetya may also be a PoC. \"HybridPetya is now at least the fourth publicly known example of a real or proof-of-concept UEFI bootkit with UEFI Secure Boot bypass functionality, joining BlackLotus (exploiting CVE‑2022‑21894), BootKitty (exploiting LogoFail), and the Hyper-V Backdoor PoC (exploiting CVE‑2020‑26200),\" ESET said. \"This shows that Secure Boot bypasses are not just possible – they're becoming more common and attractive to both researchers and attackers.\" UEFI, successor to the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), is a lucrative target for attackers. Because UEFI runs before a machine's operating system on startup, malware capable of infecting the boot process allows it to bypass traditional security software, execute malicious code with high-level privileges, and make it extremely stealthy and resilient to removal. The discovery of HybridPetya comes as security researcher FFRI Security Kazuki Matsuo detailed a technique called Shade BIOS that allows malware to operate completely independent from operating system-level security and perform nefarious actions without hardware dependence at runtime. It has been described as a \"pure-BIOS\" malware that retains BIOS in memory even after OS boot, allowing UEFI functionality and the use of drivers during runtime – giving it the power to subvert every single type of cybersecurity protection. Shade BIOS \"disassociate[s] UEFI malware from OS-level security,\" Matsuo said in a Black Hat 2025 presentation last month, and that it doesn't need to know what device the target is using or implement all driver stack or access I/O directly.",

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-5086, carries a CVSS score of 9.0 out of 10.0. According to Dassault, the issue impacts versions from Release 2020 through Release 2025. \"Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso contains a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability that could lead to a remote code execution,\" the agency said in an advisory. The addition of CVE-2025-5086 to the KEV catalog comes after the SANS Internet Storm Center reported seeing exploitation attempts targeting the flaw that originate from the IP address 156.244.33[.]162, which geolocates to Mexico. The attacks involve sending an HTTP request to the \"/apriso/WebServices/FlexNetOperationsService.svc/Invoke\" endpoint with a Base64-encoded payload that decodes to a GZIP-compressed Windows executable (\"fwitxz01.dll\"), Johannes B. Ullrich, the dean of research at the SANS Technology Institute, said. Kaspersky has flagged the DLL as \"Trojan.MSIL.Zapchast.gen,\" which the company describes as a malicious program designed to electronically spy on a user's activities, including capturing keyboard input, taking screenshots, and gathering a list of active applications, among others. \"The collected information is sent to the cybercriminal by various means, including email, FTP, and HTTP (by sending data in a request),\" the Russian cybersecurity vendor added. Zapchast variants, according to Bitdefender and Trend Micro, have been distributed via phishing emails bearing malicious attachments for over a decade. It's currently not clear if \"Trojan.MSIL.Zapchast.gen\" is an improved version of the same malware. In light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are advised to apply the necessary updates by October 2, 2025, to secure their networks.",

Containers, Kubernetes, and serverless technologies are now the default for modern enterprises, accelerating delivery but also expanding the attack surface in ways traditional security models can't keep up with. As adoption grows, so does complexity. Security teams are asked to monitor sprawling hybrid environments, sift through thousands of alerts, and protect dynamic applications that evolve multiple times per day. The question isn't just how to detect risks earlier — it's how to prioritize and respond to what really matters in real time. That's where cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs) come into play. These platforms consolidate visibility, compliance, detection, and response into a unified system. But in 2025, one capability is proving indispensable: runtime visibility. For years, cloud security has leaned heavily on preventative controls like code scanning, configuration checks, and compliance enforcement. While essential, these measures provide only part of the picture. They identify theoretical risks, but not whether those risks are active and exploitable in production. Runtime visibility fills that gap. By observing what workloads are actually running — and how they behave — security teams gain the highest fidelity signal for prioritizing threats. Runtime context answers critical questions: Without runtime, organizations risk chasing false positives while attackers exploit real weaknesses. With runtime, teams can focus on fixing the issues that matter most, reducing both noise and exposure. Modern enterprises face an avalanche of alerts across vulnerability scanners, cloud posture tools, and application security platforms. The volume isn't just overwhelming — it's unsustainable. Analysts often spend more time triaging alerts than actually fixing problems. To be effective, organizations must map vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to: This alignment is critical for bridging the gap between security and development. Developers often see security findings as disruptive, low-context interruptions. Security teams, meanwhile, lack the visibility into ownership and accountability that's needed to drive remediation. By grounding prioritization in runtime insights, enterprises can ensure that the right teams fix the right problems at the right time. Even with better prioritization, the sheer scale and complexity of cloud environments challenge human teams. This is where artificial intelligence is beginning to reshape the CNAPP landscape. AI can help by: At Sysdig, we've seen how AI can serve as a force multiplier for security teams. Our own AI security analyst, Sysdig Sage™, uses multi-step reasoning to analyze complex attack patterns and surface insights that traditional tools miss. For overburdened security operations centers (SOCs), this means faster detection and shorter mean time to resolution (MTTR). The takeaway: AI isn't replacing security teams, but it is reshaping how they operate — by filtering noise, enriching context, and enabling smarter, faster decisions. Another challenge enterprises face is accountability. Security findings are only valuable if they reach the right owner with the right context. Yet in many organizations, vulnerabilities are reported without clarity about which team should fix them. This is why mapping findings back to code artifacts, ownership, and deployment context is critical. It ensures that vulnerabilities discovered in production can be traced back to the team that introduced them. Security becomes a shared responsibility, not a siloed burden. Partnerships and integrations play a key role here. For example, Sysdig's collaboration with Semgrep enables organizations to connect runtime vulnerabilities to their originating source code, reducing the back-and-forth between teams and streamlining remediation. Enterprises have long relied on best-of-breed security tools. But in the cloud, fragmentation becomes a liability. Multiple point products generate duplicate findings, lack shared context, and increase operational overhead. CNAPP represents the next stage of consolidation. By unifying vulnerability management, posture assessment, threat detection, and incident response into a single platform, organizations can: And most importantly, they can tie everything back to runtime, ensuring that real-world threats are never lost in the noise. The rise of containers and cloud-native applications shows no sign of slowing. In fact, by the end of the decade, containers are expected to power half of all enterprise applications. With this growth comes pressure for security teams to adopt strategies that scale, simplify, and automate. The future of cloud security will be defined by three priorities: Enterprises that embrace this model will be positioned to move faster, reduce exposure, and stay ahead of attackers. Those who cling to disconnected tools and reactive processes will find themselves increasingly outpaced. The cloud has redefined how businesses build and run applications. It's now redefining how they must secure them. Runtime visibility, AI-driven prioritization, and unified platforms are no longer optional — they're essential. At Sysdig, we believe the future of cloud security is rooted in real-time context and collaboration. By focusing on what's actively happening in production, organizations can align security and development, reduce false positives, and respond to threats with confidence. The message is clear: stop chasing every alert and start focusing on what matters most.

    "content": "A security weakness has been disclosed in the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered code editor Cursor that could trigger code execution when a maliciously crafted repository is opened using the program. The issue stems from the fact that an out-of-the-box security setting is disabled by default, opening the door for attackers to run arbitrary code on users' computers with their privileges. \"Cursor ships with Workspace Trust disabled by default, so VS Code-style tasks configured with runOptions.runOn: 'folderOpen' auto-execute the moment a developer browses a project,\" Oasis Security said in an analysis. \"A malicious .vscode/tasks.json turns a casual 'open folder' into silent code execution in the user's context.\" Cursor is an AI-powered fork of Visual Studio Code, which supports a feature called Workspace Trust to allow developers to safely browse and edit code regardless of where it came from or who wrote it. With this option disabled, an attacker can make available a project in GitHub (or any platform) and include a hidden \"autorun\" instruction that instructs the IDE to execute a task as soon as a folder is opened, causing malicious code to be executed when the victim attempts to browse the booby-trapped repository in Cursor. \"This has the potential to leak sensitive credentials, modify files, or serve as a vector for broader system compromise, placing Cursor users at significant risk from supply chain attacks,\" Oasis Security researcher Erez Schwartz said. To counter this threat, users are advised to enable Workplace Trust in Cursor, open untrusted repositories in a different code editor, and audit them before opening them in the tool. The development comes as prompt injections and jailbreaks have emerged as a stealthy and systemic threat plaguing AI-powered coding and reasoning agents like Claude Code, Cline, K2 Think, and Windsurf, allowing threat actors to embed malicious instructions in sneaky ways to trick the systems into performing malicious actions or leaking data from software development environments. Software supply chain security outfit Checkmarx, in a report last week, revealed how Anthropic's newly introduced automated security reviews in Claude Code could inadvertently expose projects to security risks, including instructing it to ignore vulnerable code through prompt injections, causing developers to push malicious or insecure code past security reviews. \"In this case, a carefully written comment can convince Claude that even plainly dangerous code is completely safe,\" the company said. \"The end result: a developer – whether malicious or just trying to shut Claude up – can easily trick Claude into thinking a vulnerability is safe.\" Another problem is that the AI inspection process also generates and executes test cases, which could lead to a scenario where malicious code is run against production databases if Claude Code isn't properly sandboxed. The AI company, which also recently launched a new file creation and editing feature in Claude, has warned that the feature carries prompt injection risks due to it running in a \"sandboxed computing environment with limited internet access.\" Specifically, it's possible for a bad actor to \"inconspicuously\" add instructions via external files or websites – aka indirect prompt injection – that trick the chatbot into downloading and running untrusted code or reading sensitive data from a knowledge source connected via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). \"This means Claude can be tricked into sending information from its context (e.g., prompts, projects, data via MCP, Google integrations) to malicious third parties,\" Anthropic said. \"To mitigate these risks, we recommend you monitor Claude while using the feature and stop it if you see it using or accessing data unexpectedly.\" That's not all. Late last month, the company also revealed browser-using AI models like Claude for Chrome can face prompt injection attacks, and that it has implemented several defenses to address the threat and reduce the attack success rate of 23.6% to 11.2%. \"New forms of prompt injection attacks are also constantly being developed by malicious actors,\" it added. \"By uncovering real-world examples of unsafe behavior and new attack patterns that aren't present in controlled tests, we'll teach our models to recognize the attacks and account for the related behaviors, and ensure that safety classifiers will pick up anything that the model itself misses.\" At the same time, these tools have also been found susceptible to traditional security vulnerabilities, broadening the attack surface with potential real-world impact - \"As AI-driven development accelerates, the most pressing threats are often not exotic AI attacks but failures in classical security controls,\" Imperva said. \"To protect the growing ecosystem of 'vibe coding' platforms, security must be treated as a foundation, not an afterthought.\"",

To that end, support for C2PA's Content Credentials has been added to Pixel Camera and Google Photos apps for Android. The move, Google said, is designed to further digital media transparency. C2PA's Content Credentials are a tamper-evident, cryptographically signed digital manifest providing verifiable provenance for digital content such as images, videos, or audio files. The metadata type, according to Adobe, serves as a \"digital nutrition label,\" giving information about the creator, how it was made, and if it was generated using artificial intelligence (AI). \"The Pixel Camera app achieved Assurance Level 2, the highest security rating currently defined by the C2PA Conformance Program,\" Google's Android Security and C2PA Core teams said. \"Assurance Level 2 for a mobile app is currently only possible on the Android platform.\" \"Pixel 10 phones support on-device trusted time-stamps, which ensures images captured with your native camera app can be trusted after the certificate expires, even if they were captured when your device was offline.\" The capability is made possible using a combination of Google Tensor G5, Titan M2 security chip, and hardware-backed security features built into the Android operating system. Google said it has implemented C2PA to be secure, verifiable, and usable offline, thereby ensuring that provenance data is trustworthy, the process is not personally identifiable, and works even when the device is not connected to the internet. This is achieved using - \"C2PA Content Credentials are not the sole solution for identifying the provenance of digital media,\" Google said. \"They are, however, a tangible step toward more media transparency and trust as we continue to unlock more human creativity with AI.\"",

    "content": "It’s no coincidence that extreme heat is engulfing huge swaths of Asia, Europe and North America all at the same time. Powerful weather forces are combining to create the planetwide conditions, and there’s unlikely to be relief from the scorching temperatures anytime soon. Climate change is at the heart of what’s boosting heat to new records. But there’s more to the picture. The way the Earth and the atmosphere are wired means that the weather in one location can influence conditions on the other side of the globe, with high and low pressure zones helping to create the links. The phenomenon is called teleconnections by meteorologists, and it all has to do with how air is moving around the atmosphere. Those high and low pressure zones bring heat to some areas and flooding rains to others. Often, the systems drift over the globe. But right now, the carousel isn’t moving. It’s been cemented in place for weeks, and forecasts show it’s going to stay that way. Blame the jet stream — the \"meandering river of wind that encircles the globe and creates our weather,” as climate scientist Jennifer Francis puts it. Right now, it’s \"unusually stuck in place,” said Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. \"The multiple devastating heat domes and flooding events around the Northern Hemisphere in recent weeks are indeed connected.” The heat has had deadly consequences as domes of high pressure stay stagnant. Record-setting temperatures were blamed for a surge of deaths in Mexico, and conditions were so extreme in California’s Death Valley National Park this week that a medical helicopter was unable to respond to the scene when a 71-year-old man was dying. Phoenix, the fifth-largest U.S. city, has seen a record 21 days with temperatures above 43 degrees Celsius. Wildfires have broken out across Greece and Switzerland, while Rome has seen all-time highs and Tokyo smashed a 150-year-old heat record. Meanwhile, the low pressure systems are wreaking their own havoc as rains pour down. In India, months of blistering heat has given way to a deluge that has led to widespread damage. Floods are threatening Beijing and Tianjin in China, and two weekends in a row have brought deadly flooding to the U.S. Northeast. The pressure systems are \"like a chain,” said Paul Pastelok, senior meteorologist at commercial forecaster AccuWeather. \"It is kind of like a lock and chain — everything is connected all the way across.” One of the clearest examples of how the teleconnections work is seen with El Nino, the phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific that can upend weather patterns the world over. As surface waters become much warmer than usual, trade winds weaken or can even reverse. These changes then ripple around the globe. The world is now under its first El Nino weather in nearly four years. Currently, high pressure over the southern U.S. has ensured low pressure will dominate the Northeast. The heat domes in North Africa and Asia have been followed by low pressure downstream, which has brought deadly floods to China and set rainfall records in Japan. On top of all this, the oceans temperatures are also setting new highs. \"Once you get extremely warm oceans, it is easier to maintain heat waves” as more humidity gets unleashed, said Daniel Swain, a climatologist at the University of California Los Angeles. Scientists are also looking into a hypothesis that says under certain conditions the waves in the jet streams can lead to high and low pressure systems being locked in place. \"And that would indeed be at least consistent with what we are seeing, at least times, this summer,” Swain said in a livestream presentation Wednesday. \"It is still a hypothesis with a growing amount of evidence in its favor, but not an overwhelming amount — that’s my current personal assessment.” Still, he added, \"it’s increasingly likely that there is” something to theory.",

Cyberport has bought four GPUs made by four different mainland Chinese chipmakers and has been testing them at its AI lab to gauge which ones to adopt in the expanding facilities, Rocky Cheng Chung-ngam said in an interview with the Post on Friday. The park has been weighing the use of Chinese GPUs since it first began installing Nvidia chips last year, he said. “At that time, China-US relations were already quite strained, so relying solely on [Nvidia] was no longer an option,” Cheng said. “That is why we felt that for any new procurement, we should in any case include some from the mainland.” Cyberport’s AI supercomputing centre, established in December with its first phase offering 1,300 petaflops of computing power, will deliver another 1,700 petaflops by the end of this year, with all 3,000 petaflops currently relying on Nvidia’s H800 chips, he added. As all four Chinese solutions offer similar performance, Cyberport would take cost into account when determining which ones to order, according to Cheng, declining to name the suppliers.",

    "content": "Washington’s overtures to the region may only go so far – geographical proximity and capacity for critical mineral processing are advantages the US does not enjoy Over the past year, the US has moved to expand cooperation with Central Asian countries on critical minerals. This is being done in an effort to limit China’s chokehold on the resources that are critical to a range of industries where Beijing and Washington are locked in competition. In early August, state-owned China National Gold Group reached an agreement with Uzbekistan to expand cooperation in geological exploration in promising areas for precious metals and critical minerals. The Central Asian state boasts vast resources of minerals and metals, including copper. In 2024, China’s Limaomaoli Metal Company began building a mining complex in Tashkent which aims to produce 2.4 million tons of ore. Chinese companies also invested in other projects in Uzbekistan, such as a non-ferrous metal plant and a copper mining and processing facility, while a US$2.7 billion copper and silver development project has been proposed. Chinese involvement in Uzbekistan is also part of an effort to sideline non-regional actors. Among the main importers of Uzbekistan’s copper and iron ore are the Netherlands and Turkey, while France is interested in developing uranium with Tashkent. 08:58 What are rare earths, and why is China’s dominance facing global pushback China doesn’t just have its eye on Uzbekistan, however.

    "content": "BURNLEY, England - The Libyan city of Benghazi is perhaps the unlikeliest place to discover Motown's classic soul and funk music. Yet it was there in the north African city as the dust was still settling from the September 1969 coup d'état - spearheaded by Muammar Gaddafi - where the late Libyan artist Hasan Dhaimish first discovered his life-long infatuation for music. The then 14-year-old was on the rooftop of his home when he first tuned into his shortwave radio and the soulful music of Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye came floating out of his speakers. It was in a language he did not understand at the time, but the influence of Motown, the record company that propelled African-American musicians into the US global spotlight against the backdrop of the civil rights movement, was undoubtedly universal. Renowned in Libya for his acerbic cartoons depicting morose politicians as animal caricatures, Hasan's satirical cartoons, or Alsatoor (The Cleaver) as he was known, became the voice of the Libyan opposition rallying against Gaddafi’s government. To those familiar only with his work as his alter-ego, his art - which was simple, witty, yet incisive in its political commentary - was driven by a love for Libya and buttressed by a resolute anger towards the dictatorship that was crippling its socio-economic and political infrastructure. When we were having breakfast in a hotel in Doha once, without me even realising, he had drawn a cartoon of every single person sitting around me – Sherif Dhaimish Another creative well, however, from which Hasan drew inspiration for his art was from his insatiable love for music. Dressed in flared trousers, waistcoats and sporting an afro, like a moth to a musical flame he found himself drawn to Glastonbury and reggae festivals across the UK. But it was the vivacious and soulful cadences of jazz, blues, and soul in particular, which he discovered in the 1990s, that came alive in his artwork in a series of paintings. At the centre of a new exhibition organised by his son Sherif called \"Breezin,\" which was held at the Pendle Heritage Centre in Lancashire from 23 March to 2 April, Hasan’s jazz and blues-inspired art pays homage to musical titans such as Billie Holiday. Hasan’s son Sherif grew up observing his father and the ways in which he drew inspiration as a cartoonist from seemingly unremarkable moments. \"My dad was very unorthodox. He was constantly drawing in situations where people don't usually draw. When we were having breakfast in a hotel in Doha once, without me even realising, he had drawn a cartoon of every single person sitting around me. Whenever he was on the phone, even if it was the bank, he'd throw a piece of paper at you where he'd drawn you while you were sitting watching TV,” he said. It wasn’t until Hasan was a teenager and his older sister was getting married that he began drawing. What began as a form of catharsis, dealing with the departure of his sister from the family home, eventually turned into a form of political resistance against Gaddafi and his associates. My dad lived a pretty chaotic, free-spirited life. He did things on his own terms and he was a colourful soul - Sherif Dhaimish In 1977, he settled in a post-industrial town in the north, called Burnley, in Lancashire, England, as an asylum-seeker. In 1979, he married his wife Karen Waddington. After waitressing at restaurants over the years and eventually securing permanent residency, he went on to study his A-levels and undergraduate degree in Art and Design at the University of Bradford, eventually becoming a graphics and photography teacher at Nelson and Colne College. The \"Funky 16 Corners\" painting is one such example where Hasan used this technique. Almost three years in the making, Sherif said his father was rarely sentimental over his paintings, but this particular painting would undoubtedly have been the one he would have refused to part with. Hasan’s paintings burst with colour and the Herculean personalities of jazz singers such as Sarah Vaughan and Robert Johnson, whose musical expressions are defined and frozen with subtle strokes of black. One portrait depicts a radiant, young Billie Holiday against a backdrop of flowers exploding with warmth and ochre shades, a warmth Sherif says is a manifestation of his father’s own personality. “My dad lived a pretty chaotic, free-spirited life. He did things on his own terms and he was a colourful soul. He loved to express himself, and I think he managed to do that on the canvas,” he said. As a student at Bradford, he was exposed to other fellow artists and music enthusiasts. His belated entry into higher education became an unlikely doorway into the music of the legendary trumpet player Miles Davis in particular, whose album Doo-Bop became the focal point of his paintings. This musical journey led him down a time-warp in which he began to look at the history of blues. “He connected with it not just on a musical level, but the narratives that were behind blues and jazz music. With the blues, it's very sombre music that comes from the soul, and I think he appreciated that. He connected with that feeling of being an anomaly around here (Burnley) especially. It was a form of escapism for him.” For Hasan, who was himself a man exiled from his homeland, the narrative of struggle, of loss, and overcoming adversity resonated deeply. It was intrinsic to blues music, a genre born from slaves who toiled in the southern plantations of America, where singing away one’s troubles came floating out of their lungs as a form of catharsis but also a form of resistance. In the 70s and 80s, he had an Afro. He was very hip, very cool, he had a great dress sense - Sherif Dhaimish “Dad loved the clothes that they wore too. He himself mimicked it later in life when he wore a lot of shirts, waistcoats and [newsboy] caps. In the 70s and 80s, he had an Afro. He was very hip, very cool, he had a great dress sense.” Flitting between dualities is how Hasan spent most of his life, alternating from his role as a teacher, encouraging individuality and creativity within his students, to the life of a political dissident masquerading under the pseudonym Alsatoor. In 1979 in London, outside Earls Court tube station, he spotted a Libyan opposition magazine on a newsstand. He had gone there to attend a demonstration against the Libyan government. Upon returning home, he contacted the magazine and started publishing satirical cartoons for them, thus beginning his career as one of Libya’s most prolific political cartoonists where he went on to create his own magazine after his moniker Alsatoor. His satire wasn't just sticking donkey’s tails on politicians who were buffoons - Sherif Dhaimish Though he was fearless, Hasan’s work was not without risk. Hasan was never attacked, but the shadow of Gaddafi loomed as far as the UK where his informants were said to be hiding, and where his death squads assassinated those in opposition to him. Amnesty International reported dozens of such assassinations of Libyan dissidents outside Libya in the 1980s. It wasn’t until the advent of social media that his work became popularised. Hasan never officially disclosed his identity of Alsatoor, but followers of his work inevitably began to draw the link after the Libyan revolution in 2011, as he posted the cartoons he sketched on his Facebook page which has over 40,000 followers. As much as Hasan thrived on sketching his cartoons, his life as a cartoonist eventually became somewhat of a burden. He secured a job as a cartoonist with a Libyan news channel in Doha and also 216 TV in Jordan, following the Arab revolutions in 2011. Sherif said his father felt trapped and creatively sapped in the torrid Middle Eastern heat and sanitised surroundings of hotel rooms in Doha and Amman. Even as rainy and as miserable as it can be here in Burnley, it was home for him. He found painting and walking in this kind of weather very inspiring - Sherif Dhaimish “In the last five years of his life, the satire work took up a lot of his time. In Doha he felt he didn't have the inspiration to paint. It was a place that lacked soul. Even as rainy and as miserable as it can be here in Burnley, it was home for him. He found painting and walking in this kind of weather very inspiring. \"After the revolution, there were so many times where it was two steps forward, ten steps back with Libya. He just wanted to go back to Benghazi, put his feet in the water, and say, 'I can see it's a mess here, but I’m back now, I’ve done it and now I can just carry on with my life.' He was constantly clawing towards going back, but unfortunately it never materialised. He was never able to go back because it was too dangerous. There were too many assassinations.” Hasan passed away in 2016 at the age of 60. “I wanted to show people who only knew of his satire work what other work he did and where it was rooted. In the last few years of his life, he left the UK and his family behind for the Middle East because he felt it was his duty to do that. His satire wasn't just sticking donkey’s tails on politicians who were buffoons.” Sherif explains that his father left a mark on his followers, especially young Libyans. \"Talk to any of his former students, and they’ll tell you what a true teacher he was. He passed on wisdom and he shared ideas with young teenagers who had an interest in art. He tried to open people's minds, and I think he was successful in doing that.”",

Local people have also grown frustrated and even angry at the new arrivals for upsetting age-old customs that have governed their rural life for centuries. A local sheikh, Mohammed Gobah, told MEE that sexual harassment had regrettably become a major problem in area, but he blamed the “immodesty” of the city women. \"I had never heard of sexual harassment in this area and have only started to hear about it in the last year since the displaced people came here,” Gobah told MEE. “This means that the displaced women are the reason and not our sons.” He said that local women were respectful, wore conservative clothing and rarely left the house. When they did, they knew to be quiet and not disturb the male residents. \"I myself observed the displaced women, saw their immodest clothes, which cling close to their bodies, and saw them in the valley listening to music and laughing loudly,” he said. “It is this kind of behaviour that has attracted the young men to the area.\" Gobah said the new arrivals had caused such an upheaval that he might have to see them removed from the school if they did not rein in the immodest behaviour of their women. The situation has now deteriorated into a standoff from which neither side seems ready to back down because of the deep cultural and social rifts that separate Yemen's cities from its many villages. \"There is a social gap between the rural and urban areas and the disputes between the displaced and residents is a normal consequence of this gap,” said Fadhl al-Thobhani, a sociology professor at Taiz University. “Because of this gap, the displaced women have to imitate the women of the rural areas to avoid any harassment.” He said he saw no quick resolution to the crisis and felt the issue would only be solved once the war ended and people were allowed to return to their homes. For city women trapped in rural life, however, that day seems an eternity away. \"I never thought I was destined to live a terrible life like this, which has brought me to this prison,” Soroori said. “I stopped my studies in Taiz University and fled to this camp, but people here don't appreciate our suffering and impose restrictions on our way of life. “I always pray to Allah to free me from this prison.\" Additional reporting by Amal Mamoon This article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.",

But readability didn't matter, Medlej says. This is a \"purely spiritual script\" - it's enough just to look at it, but <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/calligraphy-in-islamic-art/\">not all types of Arabic calligraphy</a>&nbsp;are religious.</p>\n\n<p>New styles of proportional cursive scripts, like <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/learn/educators/curriculum-resources/art-of-the-islamic-world/~/media/Files/Learn/For%20Educators/Publications%20for%20Educators/Islamic%20Teacher%20Resource/Unit2.pdf\"><em>naksh</em> and <em>thuluth</em> calligraphy</a>, emerged in the 10<sup>th</sup> century. These styles were smooth and fast-flowing, easier to read and quicker to inscribe than the long, angular letterforms of early Kufic, which died in the 13<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'Some people meditate. I practise Arabic calligraphy'</p>\n\n<p><em>-&nbsp;Katrina Chouan-Choua, student</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There's no practical purpose to learning a style so long out of use, and it can take two or three hours just to write a single page - but that, Medlej explains, is part of the appeal. \"It's not about achievement or accomplishing anything; you just sink into the practice.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the class, phones are switched off and put away. Absolute focus is required for this immersive art form which rewards patience and perseverance.</p>\n\n<p>\"Some people meditate. I practise Arabic calligraphy,\" says new student Katrina Chouan-Choua, 43.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Time to slow down</strong></h3>\n\n<p>One special quality of Arabic calligraphy is the relationship between letters and the creative scope this affords. Ink pots, lined with raw silk to regulate the flow of the liquid, must be kept close for a fresh dip between each stroke, which is made using a pen cut from bamboo or reed with a slanted nib.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jihad Mikati, who is based in Tripoli, Lebanon, teaches three of the six overarching scripts, including naksh (for manuscripts, ceramics and tiles) and riqa' (for letters, edicts and manuscripts), to students at&nbsp;Al-Azm Technical Institute.</p>\n\n<p>He estimates that \"there are nearing a hundred different forms if you factor in lesser-known styles\".&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n  <figure role=\"group\" class=\"media-block\">\n  <div class=\"group-inner\">\n    <div data-embed-button=\"file_browser\" data-entity-embed-display=\"image:image\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"{\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"44c020e6-dc27-4802-8b33-0991ac74383b\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity\">  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/wysiwyg_large/public/images/sheikh%20Zayed%20Masjid%20Abu%20Dhabi.jpg.webp?itok=f3G3qtOh\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\">\n\n\n</div>\n\n    <figcaption>One of several compositions London-based calligrapher Samiur Rahman has done of The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi (Courtesy of Samiur Rahman)</figcaption>\n  </div>\n</figure>\n\n\n<p>Some of the cursive varieties take many years to master.

    "content": "LONDON - Slowly shaping each letter with a bamboo tool dipped in plant-based ink, calligrapher Joumana Medlej finds a meditative calm amid the chaos of modern life. \"In this time of constant distraction, it reacquaints you with the practice of total focus,\" she says, as she writes in ancient kufic calligraphy, named after the city of Kufah in Iraq. Kufic calligraphy first emerged at the end of the 7th century and reached its apogee under the powerful Abbasid dynasty, before its styles died out in the 13th century. \"It was part of their branding. They needed beautiful scripts to transmit their message,\" Medlej says. The Beirut-born artist has been practicing kufic calligraphy since 2007. Her weekend course on manuscript kufic at the Arab British Centre in London sells out quickly. Iraqi-British student Hajir Ibraheim enrolled with a goal to master the style in one year. \"I need a hobby outside of work, otherwise I'm on my laptop all weekend,\" the 31-year-old medic says. 'In this time of constant distraction, it reacquaints you with the practice of total focus' - Joumana Medlej, calligrapher By the end of the lesson, Iraqi-British student Malaak al-Hammdany is feeling quietly confident. Growing up, calligraphy was displayed around her family home and now she wants to explore it as a way of connecting with Arabic culture. \"It's my language, I'd like to master it in different ways,\" she says. Early kufic was characterised by static, angular upright letters and thick extended black strokes, suitable for scripting on parchment. These tapered with time as more florid forms became popular, and the simplicity of early styles gave way to the curves and flourishes of subsequent schools. More than a millennium later, a new generation is bringing these ancient styles into the modern age as they explore their affiliation with the Arab world and find creative expression with centuries-old scripts. \"There's been a revival thanks to an uptake by younger people who might once have considered it a more traditional art form,\" says British artist Ruh al-Alam, whose calligraphy clients include Google, Sony and Netflix. 'It's my language, I'd like to master it in different ways' - Malaak al-Hammdany, Iraqi-British student Before launching Archetype, his studio in London, the 37-year-old studied under a calligraphy master in Egypt. But opportunities to learn locally are improving as aspiring calligraphers seek out classes in the UK. In a polarised political climate, people are searching for something that reflects their identity, he says. \"Even more secular Arabs or Muslims, who would previously have seen calligraphy as purely religious, have embraced it.\" Curating exhibitions in the UAE, Indian Canadian artist Fathima Mohiuddin observes how Arabic calligraphy is being used to create contemporary art that's specific to the region. \"It's heritage and history meets technology and modern-day dialogue,\" she says. The work of Mohiuddin, who was born and raised in Dubai, draws subconsciously on the tradition. It can be seen in the dots on the wings of the falcon that's currently her Facebook profile picture; or how the lines are tapered to articulate space in the boisterous collages she emblazons across buildings. Calligraphy, she says, has become a way of connecting local art movements to the global scene and showcasing the riches of Islamic culture to an international crowd. The early Kufic inscriptions, which are immortalised on Islam's oldest standing monument at the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, date back to 692and were made consciously beautiful to be worthy of the message they conveyed. A hammered copper plaque from the north gate of the Dome copies passages from the Quran that emphasises the oneness of God. But readability didn't matter, Medlej says. This is a \"purely spiritual script\" - it's enough just to look at it, but not all types of Arabic calligraphy are religious. New styles of proportional cursive scripts, like naksh and thuluth calligraphy, emerged in the 10th century. These styles were smooth and fast-flowing, easier to read and quicker to inscribe than the long, angular letterforms of early Kufic, which died in the 13th century. 'Some people meditate. I practise Arabic calligraphy' - Katrina Chouan-Choua, student There's no practical purpose to learning a style so long out of use, and it can take two or three hours just to write a single page - but that, Medlej explains, is part of the appeal. \"It's not about achievement or accomplishing anything; you just sink into the practice.\" In the class, phones are switched off and put away. Absolute focus is required for this immersive art form which rewards patience and perseverance. \"Some people meditate. I practise Arabic calligraphy,\" says new student Katrina Chouan-Choua, 43. One special quality of Arabic calligraphy is the relationship between letters and the creative scope this affords. Ink pots, lined with raw silk to regulate the flow of the liquid, must be kept close for a fresh dip between each stroke, which is made using a pen cut from bamboo or reed with a slanted nib. Jihad Mikati, who is based in Tripoli, Lebanon, teaches three of the six overarching scripts, including naksh (for manuscripts, ceramics and tiles) and riqa' (for letters, edicts and manuscripts), to students at Al-Azm Technical Institute. He estimates that \"there are nearing a hundred different forms if you factor in lesser-known styles\". Some of the cursive varieties take many years to master. Samiur Rahman, 27, who manages the House of Calligraphy in east London, remembers being stuck for three months on the letter \"jeem\" at school and watching his other classmates drop out one by one. \"We live in an age where we can get everything with the click of our fingers – people want things very quickly,\" he says. But the opposite is also true as the need to reconnect with something tangible and touchable persuades people to restore a bit of analogue reality to their lives. Calligraphy, particularly Arabic scripts which arguably take the longest to inscribe, has a unique appeal to those nostalgic for the feel of pen and paper. Rahman recently took part in a 90-minute calligraphy session for A Brush with Silence, an upcoming BBC documentary called that brought together 18 artists representing different cultures from around the world. He noticed that others filled several sheets in the time it took him to write half a page - but with Arabic calligraphy \"you're forced to go slow\". Antique Qurans on display in the British Library convey the stylistic breadth of the Arabic schools. One 13th-century volume, its pages purple-spotted with age, features a distinctive type of calligraphy known as maghribi, which emerged in Morocco or Spain, when the latter was under Islamic rule. Next to it, the lavishly illuminated Sultan Baybars’ Quran is handwritten in an excitable thuluth that leaps over the lines beneath chapter headings drawn in a more composed kufic. A gold border on the richly adorned title page looks a little frayed, and the manuscript is marbled with age, but there's still no questioning the wealth and prestige of the Mamluk royal who commissioned this Quran in 14th-century Cairo. Incorporating the older script would probably have added an air of authority, explains Daniel Lowe, curator of Arabic collections at the British Library. A further six volumes are housed below in one of four basements that store the British Library's 15,000-piece Arabic manuscript collection. The 8th-century Ma’il Quran, one of the oldest in the world, is down there alongside poetic works and calligraphic albums that showcased the leading calligraphers of the day. Typically, it's academics who call these items up to the reading rooms, but sometimes artists will come seeking inspiration from calligraphers of the past. \"Our manuscript collection is a repository for the history of Arabic writing,\" says Lowe, who wants to promote wider creative engagement and give these ancient treasures a fresh lease of life via media that resonate with 21st century audiences. The collection runs right up to the 19th century, mapping the enormous range of regional variations that makes Arabic the most diverse of the calligraphic traditions. After that, it's up to future generations to draw on these riches and nurture a new era of creativity that inspires the next phase of evolution and determines the shape of Arabic scripts in years to come.

Nawzat, 42, has provided life-saving support to more than half of them, helping an estimated 1,200 Yazidi women, according to al-Qaidi. In March 2016, Nawzat received the International Women of Courage Award from then-US Secretary of State John Kerry for providing psychological support to traumatised Yazidi survivors and for combating gender-based violence.

'After I came back from captivity, Dr Nawzat sat down with me and told me that I was brave' - Shireen, IS survivor In 2014, IS seized almost a third of Iraq. At least 12,000 Yazidis were killed or kidnapped as part of what the United Nations describes as an \"ongoing genocide\" against the religious minority. The following year, Nawzat decided to Join the Duhok Survivors' Centre, where she volunteers to provide healthcare and psychological support for Iraqi women who survived IS. Funded by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), it's the only facility in Iraq that specialises in gender-based violence. The women who survived IS often have horrific stories to share. Nawzat therefore uses a post-traumatic medical approach commonly found in Iraq. Afterwards, she conducts a thorough physical check-up and then listens attentively as her patients talk about their fears and their traumatising experiences. Nawzat offers them support and positive reinforcement \"like a big sister the survivors can confide in,\" she says. According to Nawzat, as she creates a relationship with her patients based on mutual trust so they confide in her and reveal their deepest emotions and fears with ease. She is happy to meet her patients again whenever they request psychological support. In severe cases where women suffer from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or there is a suicide risk, they are referred to the nearby psychiatric department of Duhok's Azadi hospital for treatment. But her work is not without its risks to her own safety: because of her engagement with Yazidi community survivors, Nawzat says that she receives frequent death threats from IS sympathisers via the phone or social networks. Although Iraqi forces declared final victory over IS in December 2017, 1,500 Yazidi women still remain captive in Iraq, Syria and Turkey, according to al-Qaidi. Today, Sinjar is still in ruins and memories of IS brutality still weigh heavily on its people. Shireen lives alone in a tent at the Khanke Internally Displaced Population camp in Dhokok. She rejects the idea of returning to Sinjar, as most of her family members managed to obtain asylum in Germany. In 2014, Khurto Hajji Ismail, the supreme leader of the Yazidis who is known as Baba Sheikh, declared that Yazidi women who had been enslaved by IS were welcome back to the Yazidi community, an announcement that helped facilitate Nawzat's daily work and ease the women's reintegration back into the community. According to al-Qaidi, four years on Yazidi survivors are still being released by IS in exchange for ransom. For her part, Nawzat says she will continue her mission to be there for other Yazidi women and help heal their wounds. \"I dedicate my life to the Yazidis,\" she says.",

In 2015, there were 11,549 abortions and IUFDs.<blockquote><p>'I couldn’t comprehend how painful it was'</p><p><em>-&nbsp;Farah</em></p></blockquote><p>In 2016, a Lebanese doctor was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/lebanon-sex-trafficking-syrian-woman-describes-nine-month-ordeal\">arrested</a>&nbsp;for performing approximately 200 abortions on 75 Syrian sex slaves, who were brought into the country by human traffickers.

I called the one who most likely was the father. He told me we would fix it on the following Monday.

They drove to Keserwan - a district northeast of Beirut - to meet the doctor. But once there, the doctor informed them he no longer carried out abortions, so they had to resort to plan B.</p><p>Carla asked for help from a Beirut-based sexual health centre called <a href=\"https://marsa.me/\">Marsa</a>, which provides confidential and anonymous services related to sexual health. The centre advised her on doctors and gave her their locations.</p><p>“I did not want any child at this point in my life,\" she says.</p><p>She then went to a clinic operating illegally in Ain el-Remmaneh, south of Beirut, and was told by the doctors there that she was two months pregnant.</p><p>Carla remembers the room being “small and messy,” with the presence of the “aspirator” machine.

If some of them can afford it, I will charge them and give the money to the needy.”</p><p>Nadim, which is not hsi real name, charges $400 on average for the illegal procedure but does it pro-bono for those who cannot afford it.</p><blockquote><p><em>Even if the mother was raped, even if she does not have the financial means to have a child, life is a gift </em></p><p><em>-&nbsp;Father Tony Khoury, founder of \"My Right to Live”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>The gynaecologist says he generally encourages women to carry on with their pregnancies. “But if someone does not have the financial means to raise a child, is it really a good thing to force her to go through with the pregnancy?” he asks.</p><p>“I have two daughters and I sometimes wonder, if one of them got pregnant, what would I do?

Its government is structured around a power-sharing system, enshrined in its 1943 national covenant, which mandates that Christians have a majority in parliament, the prime minister has to be a Sunni Muslim, the president a Maronite Christian and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim. “Even if the mother was raped, even if she does not have the financial means to have a child, life is a gift,” he says. Through his NGO, Khoury organises conferences on abortion and he recently wrote to President Michel Aoun - in a joint letter with heads of other religious communities - to ask him to set a National Day of Life. For Afamia Kaddour, a Geneva-based coach for refugees on schooling and integration issues, “the law remains unchanged for the same reasons as the political landscape remains the same. “The political priority is to keep the status quo regarding religious communities which, most of the time, consider the oppression of women essential,” she explains.

    "content": "ISTANBUL, Turkey - One summer evening in 2013, Turkish film director Andac Haznedaroglu was driving in Istanbul when a mother holding her sick child jumped in front of her car. She found herself helping the woman, a Syrian refugee, and soon her life - and her work as a filmmaker - took a new turn, with the moment later becoming a scene in her movie. \"We went to four different hospitals to get help,\" she recalls. \"That night I realised that all these widespread claims that people were uttering about how the state was taking care of them [refugees] more than its own citizens were all wrong.\" Haznedaroglu's Misafir (The Guest) is that rare thing in Turkey, a drama portraying the refugees' stories. Written and directed by Haznedaroglu, the drama talks about the struggle of Lena, a Syrian girl, who loses her parents and crosses the border with her neighbour Maryam. Turkey hosts the largest refugee population in the world, with more than 3.5 million Syrians seeking a better life after escaping war in their homeland. But Turks have grown increasingly hostile towards people they previously called their \"guests\". More than 70 percent of the Turkish people now believe Syrian refugees are taking their jobs, while two-thirds think Syrians are responsible for increasing crime rates, according to a poll conducted by Istanbul Bilgi University’s Centre for Migration Research in 2018. Like Haznedaroglu, best-selling author Ahmet Umit uses his works aim to humanise Syrian refugees and their issues amid the popular backlash against them. His novel, Scream of the Swallow, is among the first examples of Turkish literature to put the plight of Syrian refugees centre stage. Part of the book focuses on Nevzat, a police officer trying to solve a series of murders while witnessing the desperate living conditions of Syrian refugees. At one point Evgenia, his lover, tells him: \"You know, swallows are migratory. They fly really fast. So during migration, hundreds of swallows are caught in storms and killed. \"The swallows that do make it scream with anguish and anger as they fly in the sweltering skies of the countries they've arrived in, in remembrance for the friends they've lost en route.\" 'There is hate towards them, especially among the well-educated, Westernised, and wealthy segments of the society' - Andac Haznedaroglu Umit tells MEE: \"This is the product of my understanding of what a writer's ethics should be.

Since their first arrival in 2011, Syrian refugees have been subject to false rumours and nationwide ire: often they are victims of false news on social media, as MEE has reported, and the subject of fierce discussions. Umit says that the events on New Year's Eve were perceived as different from previous rifts because this time flags were displayed, which compounding already existing anti-Syrian sentiments. 'In our history, as I mentioned in some of my books, the organisation that is called the state can be very cruel towards others in the name of protecting the homeland and the flag.

Umit stresses that for him the humanitarian side of the issue is more important than anything else. \"We can discuss the reasons of the outbreak of the Syrian war, we can discuss the foreign policy mistakes of the Turkish government, but we have to see the humanitarian aspect of the issue. There are more than three million Syrians living in this country, having fled tragedies, and as a writer, I cannot pretend that this tragedy is not taking place,\" he says. Umit believes there is still a long way to go to address the Syrian refugee issue. He says it will be considered solved when Syrian-origin writers begin writing in Turkish or Syrian-origin politicians emerge in Turkey. According to him, novels do not lead to revolutionary changes, but they can contribute to the emergence of a humane outlook. Until then, novels like his will not make tectonic changes in society, he says. \"If we can make our people think that the refugees are humans who lost their loved ones and homes to a war, they have children to care for and that these tragedies can happen to us, too, one day.\"",

Each is a small miracle, disrupting the increasingly oppressive echo system of the region and proving that the postscript for Middle East’s cinema is yet to be written.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my list of the top films of 2018:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10.&nbsp;<strong>Weldi (Dear Son)</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Tunisian director, Mohamed Ben Attia, rose to fame with his promising, if conventional, <a href=\"https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2016/03_preistraeger_2016/03_preistraeger_2016.html\">Berlinale-winning debut</a>, <em>Hedi </em>(2016). Like its predecessor, <em>Weldi </em>treads on a familiar subject matter: a middle-aged couple struggling to cope with the sudden disappearance of their teenage son and his subsequent recruitment by the Islamic State militant group. Yet the treatment is anything but conventional.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"url-embed-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVYuIr_rf10?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"الإعلان الرسمي لفيلم ولدي - Weldi (Dear Son) - Official Trailer\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>By choosing to withhold the complete details behind the son’s radicalisation and denying the parents concrete resolution or catharsis, Ben Attia has conjured up a deeply moving, slow-burning family drama about loss, grief and self-forgiveness. His sophomore effort is, by turns, subdued and powerful; detached yet highly engaging. It is a powerful film of quiet grace.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>9. Erased, Ascent of the Invisible</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon's 15-year civil war has, by and large, dominated the country's cinema for more than three decades. Just as new generations begin to turn their back to the subject, Ghassan Halwani emerges virtually out of nowhere to deliver this documentary about the disappeared victims of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Halwani uses a single photograph of an anonymous man abducted by two other people in broad daylight during<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/05/2009527115531294628.html\"> the&nbsp;Camps War </a>in 1986, as a starting point for a reflective investigation on collective amnesia and the brutal moral cost of an enforced peace.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"url-embed-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2vfMQR-mQY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"ERASED,___ASCENT OF THE INVISIBLE Trailer | TIFF 2018\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Incorporating animation and documentary footage with off-screen testimonials and written texts, Halwani scavenges the pockmarked walls of Beirut to unearth posters of the missing from underneath endless layers of advertisements. As entire generations born after the war grapple to make sense of their nation’s tarnished history, Halwani suggests that remembrance of those who vanished beyond trace, those who lost their individuality, is not simply a matter of political recognition - it’s a moral duty.</p>\n\n<div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    <script async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-6114695881218027\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6114695881218027\" data-ad-slot=\"8690493793\" data-ad-format=\"horizontal\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"></ins>\n<script>\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3><strong>8. Dream Away</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Having explored the role of image in journalism before and after the 2011 Egyptian revolution in the 47-minute film&nbsp;<em>Crop </em>(2013) , Egyptian director Marouan Omara has reteamed with German filmmaker Johanna Domke for their first full-length feature. Dream Away is a quasi-experimental documentary following a group of seven different workers in a Sharm El Sheikh resort depleted by the economic crisis and loss of tourist trade that followed the 2011 revolution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Omara and Domke infuse the candid testimonials of their subjects with surreal flourishes, most notably in the gigantic moving monkey asking the young workers about their dreams and wishes in the Red Sea resort, while brilliantly capturing the sparseness of this once booming and now abandoned tourist hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"url-embed-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Vv2-x_ETOA?start=3&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Film Trailer: Dream Away\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>An understated commentary on the unfulfilled promises of the miscarried revolution, Omara and Domke’s Egypt is populated by&nbsp;lost souls stranded in an indefinite purgatory. Innovative and evocative in equal measures, <em>Dream Away</em> is also one of the most beautifully photographed Middle Eastern movies of late.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>7. The Day I Lost My Shadow&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>A young mother is thrust in a nightmarish journey in the Syrian backlands as she quixotically searches for a cooking gas cylinder at the beginning of the civil war in 2011. As time passes by, she observes people without shadows: men and women who have been scarred for life by death, loss or violence.</p>\n\n<p>In her auspicious fiction debut – which earned Venice’s Lion of the Future prize for best first feature – director Soudade Kaadan lends her hard-boiled realism treatment of the war a fantastical touch, inspired by folk traditions and the magical realism of Spanish master, Víctor Erice (<em>Spirit of the Beehive, 1973</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"url-embed-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iti6SQC_GT0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"The Day I lost My Shadow - Trailer يوم أضعت ظلي\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Politics and religion are largely sidelined, as the quotidian chores turn into herculean endeavours that are transformed beyond recognition.</p>\n\n<p>Kaadan’s reconstructed Syria is a place of ghosts and vengeful demons; a wasteland haunted by unavoidable death and looming destruction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    <script async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-6114695881218027\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6114695881218027\" data-ad-slot=\"8690493793\" data-ad-format=\"horizontal\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"></ins>\n<script>\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3><strong>6. Invasion</strong></h3>\n\n<p>This film&nbsp;cements&nbsp;Iranian filmmaker Shahram Mokri's&nbsp;reputation as one of the most fascinating, unorthodox talents working in Iran today: a genre-bending horror flick shot in one long take. The post-apocalyptic stadium backdrop acts as an ominous playground for a murder mystery that sees members of an unidentified sports squad using a police investigation to carry out more killings. The sister of the slain victim – who may or may not be a vampire - barges into the scene to turn the procedure on its head.</p>\n\n<p><em>Invasion</em> is pure bravura filmmaking; an anarchic vampire fable borrowing elements from the Russian cinema of Alexander Sokurov, as well as the traditional Ta'ziyeh,&nbsp;a Shia passion play, that focuses on the murder of Imam Hussein, grandson of the prophet Mohammed, in the 7<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVG4hr5iqK8\" width=\"560\"></iframe>Beneath the stunning filmmaking, however, lies a clandestine commentary on Iran’s decaying power structure, the crumbling patriarchy and a volatile youthful female force hellbent on shaking its core foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Chaos</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Syrian director Sara Fattahi directs her lens towards three middle-class women dealing with the consequences of the war;&nbsp;a mother, an actor and an artist, as well as Fattahi herself – attempt and fail to shake off their traumatic memories as they struggle to settle in their new Vienna home.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"url-embed-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-RQ49Bz_rY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"IDFA 2018 | Trailer | Chaos\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Their Syrian domestic detainment has been replaced by inner confinement and their exile has augmented their isolation and inner torment. Contrary to familiar documentaries about Syria, <em>Chaos&nbsp;</em>contains no action nor sketches of triumphant immigrants and no record of destitute refugees at the European borders.</p>\n\n<p>The silence of Fattahi’s women and their banal rituals are impregnated with naked emotions that have no release. <em>Chaos,</em> in its stark honesty, could very well be one of the most truthful documents of the Syrian war.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. The Announcement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Four Turkish military men embark on a nocturnal journey over the course of one long evening to take control of an Istanbul radio station and announce what would unfold into the now forgotten <a href=\"https://www.trtworld.com/turkey/military-takeovers-in-recent-turkish-history-398334\">1963 failed coup.</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-text align-right\">\n    <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Shooting a film about a coup in Turkey - then the real shooting started</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/shooting-film-about-coup-turkey-then-real-shooting-started\">Read More »</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is the unusual setup for Mahmut Fazil Coskun’s triumphant third feature: a deadpan, dark political satire about decadent patriarchy, institutional incompetence, and skewed morality. It also happens to be the funniest Middle Eastern comedy of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"url-embed-wrapper\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hPWgdcA0bU</div>\n\n<p>Relying on meticulously composed long takes that are occasionally intercepted by bouts of sudden bloodshed, Coskun delivers his staunch criticism with fierce imagination and confidence, holding a mirror to present-day Turkish politics with all its absurdity, corruption and violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Yara</strong></h3>\n\n<p>After producing one of the century’s quintessential records of Iraq with 2015’s five-plus hour documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEXvk8mT4uU\">Homeland </a>(Iraq Year Zero)</em>, Iraqi-French director Abbas Fahdel takes an acute detour with <em>Yara</em>, a thinly plotted Lebanese romance between the eponymous teenage girl and a soon-to-be immigrant boy.</p>\n\n<p>Set in the Kadisha Valley in the Northern mountains, <em>Yara</em> is the rarest of Middle Eastern films: a chaste cinematic feast devoid of any political or social subtext. Little happens in Yara’s tranquil universe, as Fahdel patiently, lovingly observes the bucolic daily routines, the little talks and the innocuous courtship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://cineuropa.org/en/videoembed/357966/rdid/357231/\" webkitallowfullscreen width=\"620\"></iframe>In realising a simple Arab romance at such politically troubled times, Fahdel has crafted a piece of transcending cinema that believes in the possibility of human goodness and the spiritual power of beauty. <em>Yara</em> is both a delight for the senses and a panacea for the soul.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. The Reports on Sarah and Saleem</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The emergence of Palestinian filmmaker Muayad Alayan in 2015 with the Brechtian comedy thriller, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osCXQRGLIOw\"><em>Love, Theft and Other Entanglements</em></a>, was met with unease by the Arab film community. A forward-looking director openly laying bare the increasingly complicated dynamic between Palestinians and Israelis, Alayan went a step further with his follow-up effort which <a href=\"https://972mag.com/palestinian-film-festival-seeks-to-challenge-israels-cultural-erasure/134007/\">incited the ire </a>of the boycott,&nbsp;divestment and sanctions movement by casting two Israeli actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Based on a true story, Alayan charts the extramarital affair between the titular Palestinian driver and the Israeli wife of a high-ranking military official as it spirals into a political standoff between the two rival countries when it’s discovered.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Reports on Sarah and Saleem</em> is a painfully honest, audaciously grounded view of a prejudiced society where simple sexual infidelity becomes a political impasse. With an admirable objective lens, Alayan exposes the racist, unjust Israeli legal system – an extension of an apartheid state where Palestinians continue to be treated as second-rate citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"url-embed-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r913j8rbkT8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"'The Reports On Sarah And Saleem' (IFFR 2018) first trailer\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Yet Alayan also refuses to succumb to the mandatory hagiographic depiction of his countrymen, painting an unflattering picture of a community still fixated on hero-worship. There are no sympathetic characters in Alayan’s world and no blameless individuals fighting for a lofty cause. The women and men in this place, as seen from Alayan’s non-judgmental lens, are lustful, transgressive, vain and weak.</p>\n\n<p>They are real and all the more human.</p>\n\n<div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    <script async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-6114695881218027\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6114695881218027\" data-ad-slot=\"8690493793\" data-ad-format=\"horizontal\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"></ins>\n<script>\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3><strong>1.

    "content": "After disappointing festival representation and a modest box-office performance in 2017, Middle Eastern film bounced back in 2018. It is a year that shall be regarded as a milestone in the raggedy, unpredictable fortunes of the region's cinema. Lebanon scored its first Oscar nomination for the foreign-language category with Ziad Doueiri’s provocative film The Insult and the first Cannes prize in 27 years with Nadine Labaki’s third-place Jury Prize winner, Capernaum, which also became the nation’s second Golden Globe nominee. Iran continued its festival domination with Jafar Panahi’s Cannes best script winner, Three Faces. Palestine won big in Rotterdam with Muayad Alayan’s The Reports on Sarah and Saleem, which went home with the special jury award for the film's screenplay. Egypt emerged out of its creative slump with three global hits: AB Shawky’s Palm d’Or nominee, Yomeddine; Marouan Omara and Johanna Domke’s Dreamaway - which premiered at the Karlovy Vary film festival and later competed in London, in addition to Ahmad Abdalla’s Toronto pick EXT. Night. Syria made the biggest splash in Middle Eastern cinema this year. The war-torn country scored its first Oscar nomination with Feras Fayyad and Steen Johannessen’s documentary, Last Men in Aleppo. And Soudade Kaadan became the first Syrian filmmaker to receive an award in Venice with her debut feature narrative, The Day I Lost My Shadow. Saeed al-Batal and Ghiath Ayoub won the top prize at the Venice Critics’ Week with the documentary, Still Recording and Talal Derki was bestowed with his second Grand Jury Prize at Sundance’s World Cinema documentary event with the Oscar-shortlisted, Of Fathers and Sons. Many of the Middle East cinema's habitual themes – refugees, poverty, the subjection of women, war, sectarianism – remain intact and continue to attract funding bodies and festival programmers alike. Although, the selection of the road movie Yomeddine in the Cannes competition, along with the success of Tolga Karacelik’s Sundance-winning Turkish comedy, Butterflies, and Abdelhamid Bouchnak’s Venice-picked Tunisian horror, Dachra, demonstrated the growing appetite for out of the box stories from the region. What distinguishes the best of 2018’s crop is their shrewd political commentary, which has been infused in universal stories about familial dysfunction, impotent machismo, sexual infidelity and teenage angst. Each is a small miracle, disrupting the increasingly oppressive echo system of the region and proving that the postscript for Middle East’s cinema is yet to be written. Here is my list of the top films of 2018: Tunisian director, Mohamed Ben Attia, rose to fame with his promising, if conventional, Berlinale-winning debut, Hedi (2016). Like its predecessor, Weldi treads on a familiar subject matter: a middle-aged couple struggling to cope with the sudden disappearance of their teenage son and his subsequent recruitment by the Islamic State militant group. Yet the treatment is anything but conventional. By choosing to withhold the complete details behind the son’s radicalisation and denying the parents concrete resolution or catharsis, Ben Attia has conjured up a deeply moving, slow-burning family drama about loss, grief and self-forgiveness. His sophomore effort is, by turns, subdued and powerful; detached yet highly engaging. It is a powerful film of quiet grace. Lebanon's 15-year civil war has, by and large, dominated the country's cinema for more than three decades. Just as new generations begin to turn their back to the subject, Ghassan Halwani emerges virtually out of nowhere to deliver this documentary about the disappeared victims of the war. Halwani uses a single photograph of an anonymous man abducted by two other people in broad daylight during the Camps War in 1986, as a starting point for a reflective investigation on collective amnesia and the brutal moral cost of an enforced peace. Incorporating animation and documentary footage with off-screen testimonials and written texts, Halwani scavenges the pockmarked walls of Beirut to unearth posters of the missing from underneath endless layers of advertisements. As entire generations born after the war grapple to make sense of their nation’s tarnished history, Halwani suggests that remembrance of those who vanished beyond trace, those who lost their individuality, is not simply a matter of political recognition - it’s a moral duty. Having explored the role of image in journalism before and after the 2011 Egyptian revolution in the 47-minute film Crop (2013) , Egyptian director Marouan Omara has reteamed with German filmmaker Johanna Domke for their first full-length feature. Dream Away is a quasi-experimental documentary following a group of seven different workers in a Sharm El Sheikh resort depleted by the economic crisis and loss of tourist trade that followed the 2011 revolution. Omara and Domke infuse the candid testimonials of their subjects with surreal flourishes, most notably in the gigantic moving monkey asking the young workers about their dreams and wishes in the Red Sea resort, while brilliantly capturing the sparseness of this once booming and now abandoned tourist hub. An understated commentary on the unfulfilled promises of the miscarried revolution, Omara and Domke’s Egypt is populated by lost souls stranded in an indefinite purgatory. Innovative and evocative in equal measures, Dream Away is also one of the most beautifully photographed Middle Eastern movies of late. 7. The Day I Lost My Shadow A young mother is thrust in a nightmarish journey in the Syrian backlands as she quixotically searches for a cooking gas cylinder at the beginning of the civil war in 2011. As time passes by, she observes people without shadows: men and women who have been scarred for life by death, loss or violence. In her auspicious fiction debut – which earned Venice’s Lion of the Future prize for best first feature – director Soudade Kaadan lends her hard-boiled realism treatment of the war a fantastical touch, inspired by folk traditions and the magical realism of Spanish master, Víctor Erice (Spirit of the Beehive, 1973). Politics and religion are largely sidelined, as the quotidian chores turn into herculean endeavours that are transformed beyond recognition. Kaadan’s reconstructed Syria is a place of ghosts and vengeful demons; a wasteland haunted by unavoidable death and looming destruction. This film cements Iranian filmmaker Shahram Mokri's reputation as one of the most fascinating, unorthodox talents working in Iran today: a genre-bending horror flick shot in one long take. The post-apocalyptic stadium backdrop acts as an ominous playground for a murder mystery that sees members of an unidentified sports squad using a police investigation to carry out more killings. The sister of the slain victim – who may or may not be a vampire - barges into the scene to turn the procedure on its head. Invasion is pure bravura filmmaking; an anarchic vampire fable borrowing elements from the Russian cinema of Alexander Sokurov, as well as the traditional Ta'ziyeh, a Shia passion play, that focuses on the murder of Imam Hussein, grandson of the prophet Mohammed, in the 7th century. Beneath the stunning filmmaking, however, lies a clandestine commentary on Iran’s decaying power structure, the crumbling patriarchy and a volatile youthful female force hellbent on shaking its core foundation. Syrian director Sara Fattahi directs her lens towards three middle-class women dealing with the consequences of the war; a mother, an actor and an artist, as well as Fattahi herself – attempt and fail to shake off their traumatic memories as they struggle to settle in their new Vienna home. Their Syrian domestic detainment has been replaced by inner confinement and their exile has augmented their isolation and inner torment. Contrary to familiar documentaries about Syria, Chaos contains no action nor sketches of triumphant immigrants and no record of destitute refugees at the European borders. The silence of Fattahi’s women and their banal rituals are impregnated with naked emotions that have no release. Chaos, in its stark honesty, could very well be one of the most truthful documents of the Syrian war. Four Turkish military men embark on a nocturnal journey over the course of one long evening to take control of an Istanbul radio station and announce what would unfold into the now forgotten 1963 failed coup. This is the unusual setup for Mahmut Fazil Coskun’s triumphant third feature: a deadpan, dark political satire about decadent patriarchy, institutional incompetence, and skewed morality. It also happens to be the funniest Middle Eastern comedy of the year. Relying on meticulously composed long takes that are occasionally intercepted by bouts of sudden bloodshed, Coskun delivers his staunch criticism with fierce imagination and confidence, holding a mirror to present-day Turkish politics with all its absurdity, corruption and violence. After producing one of the century’s quintessential records of Iraq with 2015’s five-plus hour documentary, Homeland (Iraq Year Zero), Iraqi-French director Abbas Fahdel takes an acute detour with Yara, a thinly plotted Lebanese romance between the eponymous teenage girl and a soon-to-be immigrant boy. Set in the Kadisha Valley in the Northern mountains, Yara is the rarest of Middle Eastern films: a chaste cinematic feast devoid of any political or social subtext. Little happens in Yara’s tranquil universe, as Fahdel patiently, lovingly observes the bucolic daily routines, the little talks and the innocuous courtship. In realising a simple Arab romance at such politically troubled times, Fahdel has crafted a piece of transcending cinema that believes in the possibility of human goodness and the spiritual power of beauty. Yara is both a delight for the senses and a panacea for the soul. The emergence of Palestinian filmmaker Muayad Alayan in 2015 with the Brechtian comedy thriller, Love, Theft and Other Entanglements, was met with unease by the Arab film community. A forward-looking director openly laying bare the increasingly complicated dynamic between Palestinians and Israelis, Alayan went a step further with his follow-up effort which incited the ire of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement by casting two Israeli actors. Based on a true story, Alayan charts the extramarital affair between the titular Palestinian driver and the Israeli wife of a high-ranking military official as it spirals into a political standoff between the two rival countries when it’s discovered. The Reports on Sarah and Saleem is a painfully honest, audaciously grounded view of a prejudiced society where simple sexual infidelity becomes a political impasse. With an admirable objective lens, Alayan exposes the racist, unjust Israeli legal system – an extension of an apartheid state where Palestinians continue to be treated as second-rate citizens. Yet Alayan also refuses to succumb to the mandatory hagiographic depiction of his countrymen, painting an unflattering picture of a community still fixated on hero-worship. There are no sympathetic characters in Alayan’s world and no blameless individuals fighting for a lofty cause. The women and men in this place, as seen from Alayan’s non-judgmental lens, are lustful, transgressive, vain and weak. They are real and all the more human. To say that few were looking forward to seeing Turkish master Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s latest outing would not be an overstatement. The prospect of sitting through a 190-minute family drama was daunting to say the least. As it turned out, Ceylan has created a modern masterpiece that ranks among his very best work, and above his overvalued Palm d’Or winner, Winter Sleep. An achingly intimate Chekhovian tale about an aspiring young writer returning to his rural village after graduation and coming face to face with his dysfunctional family, The Wild Pear Tree uses little of Ceylan’s signature striking visuals, replacing them with lengthy dialogue rich with psychological revelations and philosophical meditations. The film is arguably Ceylan’s warmest and most humane: a heartfelt tale touching upon the inevitable disappointments of life, the agony of growing up and irreconcilable intergenerational disquiet. Filled with irony and humour, it’s also Ceylan’s most political movie to date, implicitly pointing to the growing role of religion in everyday Turkish life and towards the longing for a saviour in face of institutional failure. Few filmmakers can wield such myriad strands so seamlessly and so effortlessly as Ceylan can. He is Turkey’s great chronicler of contemporary national life who, with his latest opus, has made the ultimate Anatolian state of the nation movie.",

    "content": "LOS ANGELES, USA - The story of Arab cinema is partially defined by unfulfilled potentials, thwarted ambitions and amputated careers. Scorching talents, aesthetical innovation and defiant politics have also been overlooked time and time again. The stories of Jocelyne Saab, a Lebanese journalist, artist and filmmaker, and Egyptian director Oussama Fawzi are no different. The two celebrated film auteurs passed away on 7 January and 9 January, respectively, aged 70 and 58, leaving behind a small body of work that ranks among the most singular in modern Arab cinema. I met Saab for the first time in 2014 in Cairo while she was researching for a musical project set in the early years of Egyptian cinema. And my correspondence with Fawzi was strictly viral, when I programmed his film, Fallen Angels Paradise (1999) last September at the Safar Film Festival in London for its long-delayed UK premiere. Their cinematic oeuvres appear to share little resemblance, but on closer inspection, similarities begin to arise. Both presented atypical, confrontational portraits of their home countries. Both only had four feature films to their names, wore their liberal politics on their sleeves and adopted atypical narrative frameworks. Both were never given due recognition internationally and struggled to find financing for their projects. Their films deviated from convention, combining raw realism with surrealism while shattering stereotypical representations of their nations. Born in 1948 in Beirut, Saab studied economics in Paris before moving to journalism and subsequently documentary film-making with the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. Her directorial debut, Lebanon in a Whirlwind (1975), was a valiant and ultimately futile attempt to make sense of the senseless - the then-unfolding conflict. Interviewing the likes of Druze leader Kamal Jumblatt, and Christian Phalangist party founder Pierre Gemayel, Lebanon in a Whirlwind provided a preview of Saab’s faculties, namely a firm command of the material, a remarkable even-handedness and a notably calm tonality. Her subsequent non-fiction work would see her directing her lens to the unfolding destruction of her hometown. In her Beirut trilogy - Beirut, Never More (1976), A Letter from Beirut (1979) and Beirut, My City (1982), Saab began her career-long quest of probing the individual’s relationship with their cities, including their fictitious histories, their uncertain present and their profound psychological impact. In their evocation of loss, memory and identity, Saab’s work has often been compared to French filmmaker Alain Resnais, whose films explored the subjectivity of individual memory and the distorting impact of war on it. Saab’s early work was typified by one central internal conflict and a journalistic determination to expose the city unadorned. Her films encompassed a nostalgic desire to recreate the fantastical place of her childhood: between the whimsical, unreal past, and the ugly, tangible present. This tendency would continue to inform her other city portraits, particularly Cairo and her short documentary, Egypt City of the Dead (1978). In 1985, Saab made her narrative fiction debut with A Suspended Life, a bittersweet tale about a budding friendship between a teenage girl from the south of Lebanon and an artist from west Beirut. The schism between the real and the imagined is front and centre. It is depicted in the contrast of the girl’s fixation on the wonderlands of Egyptian cinema and the overriding destruction around her. And, off-camera, in Saab’s yearning for reconciliation among the squabbling sects, and the gory, hostile reality on the ground. It would take Saab another 10 years to produce her sophomore effort, Once Upon a Time, Beirut (1995), which was also her first feature after the end of the 15-year war. A girl (Michèle Tyan), celebrating her 20th birthday, takes her best friend (Myrna Maakaron) to visit a mysterious old film collector, Emile Accar, and asks him to show them his Beirut - the Beirut they never know. Fact and fiction blur as the two struggle to distinguish the mythical from the real. Saab has been erroneously dubbed as the great chronicler of lost Lebanese memory. Memory is certainly one of her crucial preoccupations: the personal, the collective and the imagined. Saab’s notion of memory is Proustian: slippery, unreliable and transient. Yet what Once Upon a Time, Beirut ultimately does is question the myths behind these memories, be they historical, sectarian or filmic. The great Beirut propagated by the movies of the 1960s, of being the liberal, prosperous, cosmopolitan Switzerland of the East, may have been nothing but a figment of the Arab imagination – a shiny facade concealing the odium, aggression and the moral bankruptcy that would explode with the civil war. This was all done in a largely plotless narrative conceived with a witty, unruly and inventive visual style that demonstrated a confident craftswoman exploring the limitless possibilities of what cinema can do. Once Upon a Time, Beirut remains one of the most novel, most affecting Arab films of the 1990s, and Saab’s unrivalled masterwork. Ten more years would pass before Saab directed another narrative fiction, the Sundance entry Dunia (2005), an Egyptian musical about a twentysomething literature student, played by Hanan Turk, who is aspiring to be a dancer. Drawing inspiration from 1001 Nights, Arabic poetry and Egyptian classical melodramas, Dunia was Saab’s most candid feminist statement: an attack on patriarchy and socio-religious traditions and a cry for self-emancipation and self-actualisation. Handled with sensitivity and earnestness, it was, nonetheless, met by hostile and critical reaction in Egypt, particularly for its handling of genital mutilation in one plotline, along with its deliberately disjointed narration. The same disjointed narrative would be adopted in Saab’s fourth feature, What’s Going On? (2009), a surreal fable set in Beirut about a writer and a dressmaker (played by celebrated author, Jalal Khoury) who encounters three different women who teach him different lessons about women, love and life. All the women, in one way or another, are different manifestations of Beirut, each representing a different identity of the city. While Saab’s fondness and, occasionally, naïve belief in Beirut offset the reality she didn’t shy away from tackling, there was nothing remotely bright to temper Oussama Fawzy’s stark vision of Cairo, his home city. Born in 1961, his father was Girgis Fawzy, a prominent producer. Fawzi cut his teeth on film as an assistant director to notable directors including Yousry Nasrallah, Radwan El-Kashef, and Ra’fat El Meehy. Oussama made his directorial debut with the Locarno Film Festival competition entry, Afarit el-asphalt (Phantoms of the Road, 1996), a medium-sized production about a group of bus drivers navigating their way in a decaying post-socialist Cairo. Weaving an intricate web of relationships delineated by power struggles and sexual infidelities, Fawzi’s world was a far cry from the morally conservative neo-realist Egyptian films of the 1980s. His films cast an intense non-judgmental eye on a godless working-class world governed by stifled dreams, raging libidos and acceptance of a reality that would not change. The mix of the surreal with the real in Fawzi’s movies are rooted in the works of Italian maestro Federico Fellini, and Spanish provocateur Luis Buñuel, while his liberal politics owes a great debt to the films of fellow countryman, Yousry Nasrallah. Like Saab, Fawzi had a knack for seamlessly mixing the bizarre with the real. More than Saab, however, he constantly revelled in the fundamental act of storytelling, searching for meaning in a meaningless time and place. Fawzi would delve further into the metaphysical in 1999 with his next feature, Ganet al-shayateen (Fallen Angels Paradise) which also competed at Locarno. Based on a short story by Brazilian writer Jorge Amado, the black comedy centres on a middle-aged hoodlum (played by frequent collaborator, Mahmoud Hemeida) who suddenly dies of a heart attack. His young thug brethren find out that he was once the respected head of a Coptic Christian family and embark on a nocturnal journey to deliver his corpse, while suspecting that he may not be dead after all. One of the most original and audacious Egyptian productions of the 1990s, Fallen Angels Paradise made little money at the local box-office but would later become a cult hit, establishing Fawzi as one of the most unique talents in contemporary Egyptian cinema. It was, after all, fronted by a dead protagonist and contained no traditionally sympathetic characters. It also starred a number of young actors, including Amr Waked, who later starred in Syriana (2005) opposite George Clooney, and Lucy (2014) with Scarlett Johansson. Fallen Angels Paradise was unlike anything that had been seen before in Egyptian cinema at the time, and 20 years after its release it still retains the power to shock, provoke and astonish. It remains Fawzi’s darkest film, a frenzied journey into the abyss of the human soul which shrewdly explores the elusive nature of death, the taxing weight of choice and the indefinable parameters of morality. Above all, it is about class and the expanding division between the shackling privileges of the bourgeoisie and the forebodingly limitless freedoms of the outlaws. Concluding with an orgy in a car, Fallen Angels Paradise ultimately unfolds into a colossal celebration of transgression: another Egyptian underworld where lust, fraternity and sheer instinct for survival trump any religious or social code. The film was also distinct for being among the rare pictures to feature a Christian protagonist. Fawzi would go one step further in 2004 with Baheb el-cima (I Love Cinema), the biggest commercial hit of his career and his most controversial work. The film is a semi-autobiographical story of a young boy (Youssef Othman) finding respite in cinema from his ultra-religious orthodox father in the waning days of the Gamal Abdel Nasser era. It remains the only Egyptian film to highlight, explore and criticise Christian orthodox doctrine, with an unfaltering depiction of Orthodox rituals and lifestyle. Not surprisingly it incited the ire of the Coptic church, propelling lawyers to file lawsuits that accused Fawzi – a former Christian who converted to Islam – of insulting Christian doctrine. It was also Fawzi’s most political work, acting as an exorcism of his childhood demons and as a confrontation with the political and religious dogma that he grew to rebel against. The father’s extreme religiosity is depicted as a by-product of Egypt’s larger authoritarian political climate – another form of control passed on by a generation that dare not think, question, or protest. Taking a leaf out of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman’s playbook, the father’s questioning of the silence of God was the first instance in Egyptian cinema where doubt over the benevolence, even the existence of God, was expressed so explicitly. Cinema, in Fawzi’s world, functions not only as a vehicle of escapism but as a tool of resistance. The same goes with sex and art: two interlinked modes of expressions that offer a glimpse of freedom from the tyrannical family structure – an institution disparaged in all of Fawzi’s work. Art takes centre stage in Fawzi’s last feature, Bel alwan al-tabeaya (In True Colors, 2009), a colourful inspection of visual art in an increasingly religious society torn between its secular past and conservative present. The art student lead, Karim Kasem, attempts to reconcile his confused and stifling religious beliefs and the freedoms ingrained in the act of creation. More than his previous films, In True Colours contains the most blatant indictment of the Mubarak age, an era where everything – religion, art, knowledge – has been institutionalised; where everything has been robbed of its essence and where everything has been compartmentalised, privatised and deformed. The Western viewer becomes a major factor in the filmic equation. In the worst instances, the director-as-guide is suddenly conducting an audience of tourists through of his culture - Jocelyne Saab Both Oussama Fawzi and Jocelyne Saab were passionate, resilient and strangely defiant. Each was sidelined and marginalised by their respective industries. They were also too radical and insubordinate for their societies and punished for adhering to their idiosyncratic form of art-making. Saab, who relied mostly on French money to bankroll her movies, was forced to comply to the demands of the French, especially in the usage of French dialogue. “When I get financing of five million francs from France, I run the risk of having to change my scenario,” she explained in 1989. “Not always, but frequent enough, changes are made. The Western viewer becomes a major factor in the filmic equation. In the worst instances, the director-as-guide is suddenly conducting an audience of tourists through of his culture.” Fawzi, on the other hand, had to apply for Cairo International Film Festival’s Cairo Connection co-production platform last November, and pitch his project, like young filmmakers, to foreign producers after failing to find producers at home willing to back his new endeavour. While their work shall inspire generations to come, it may also transpire as a cautionary tale about the heavy price Arab filmmakers must pay to fully realise their visions.",
